# Wave 2 Online 

## W2 Checklists Online 

----------- 

### W2 Checklist - Initial Online 

**Calling participants from REDCap** 

- Participants can be considered “recontact in a month” if they meet all of the following criteria: 
  - Researcher has tried to contact individual at different times of day. 
  - Researcher has used at least 3 different approaches (e.g. email, phone, text message), UNLESS only 2 forms of contact have been given, in which case participant should fully meet all other criteria. 
  - Researcher has been reaching out for two weeks ( contact at least every three days in some format)  
  - Situation is NOT considered "phone tag" (a participant calls and lab member returns call but keeps missing one another- this shows participant may still be interested, therefore number of contact and lack of response may not be due to lack of interest. Participants in "phone tag" situation should stay on contact list). 

**Important Reminders** 

  **Calendar** 
  
  - Put the W2 for wave two ( e.g. S1 W2 ) on session events 
  - For reminder emails put Status: Incomplete in description 
  - For Session 1 Reminder 1 call event put “Only if no email response” in the description and then status: Incomplete 
  - Whenever you complete a reminder event mark it as complete and update the MBB participant log  
  
  **Emails to participants** 

  - All emails to a participant should be in the same thread  
  - **Remember that email templates need to be edited**(e.g. there are no written responses in wave 2 so that chunk should be deleted, there is no ASA in wave 1 so that should be deleted in wave 1, etc.)
  - The thread we initially contacted them at should be the one we send the session confirmation to  
  - The easiest way to not forget steps is to do all “session has just been scheduled” tasks based on the MBB log  
  - Make sure you are sending the correct reminder email - S1 R2 is the one with the researcher card  
  
  **Confirming sessions** 

  - Do not put as “confirmed session” on MBB log unless we got verbal confirmation / email confirmation 
  - If called and no answer leave a note on the calendar event saying was not able to verbally confirm & also put into SRA chat  
  

  **REDCap**  

  - When you schedule a new MBB participant change their SMBB “Wave 2 status” to enrolled  
  - Make a new screening entry every time you schedule a participant
  - **For participant instrument - Age should be the age of participant at the time of *Session 1* **

 
**Scheduling and Confirmation** 

- Schedule session 1 two weeks in advance from "package mailing day" (see package preparation in pre-session checklist) 

- Schedule session 2 ~one week after session 1 

- Ask lab manager to make Zoom link with scheduled session times and save to google calendar 

- Send session 1 confirmation email (in templates) 

   - Attach [Infographic](https://app.box.com/file/776654994352), [Next Steps](https://app.box.com/file/774936561660), [Computer Zoom Download Instructions](https://ucla.app.box.com/file/680632734387)

- Enroll participant in Wave 2 on REDCap 
  - Go to “Add / Edit Records” of MBB 
  - Make sure the tab is “Arm 3: wave 2”

  - **Age should be the age of participant at the time of *Session 1* **
  - In notes section add the date and time of session, recollected surveys needed & any relevant info from scheduling call  
  - **Essential to fill out the “Is this wave 2” question**

#### Setup - 1 Hour Prior 

- Open up Zoom link for Session 1 
- Read "participant" information instrument on REDCap for notes section for any notes from the scheduler about child 
  - Check for note on whether or not parent wanted questionnaires to be given online or on paper, adjust script accordingly
  - the participant info should also contain info about whether there are recollected surveys to administer (both that parent received in parent survey packet or child surveys we'll administer in session)
  - If there is a child survey that needs to be recollected get the survey code so that it can be easily accessed during session
- Check to see if they did blood sample last year, it's in the participant log on the Wave 1 - Data Entry sheet. 
  - If they didn’t last year it might be really helpful to explain arm poke in detail early on, during initial presentation, before they consent. 
- Open Slack and keep open for entirety of session for communication with the research team/Lab Manager 
- Claim host so you have the ability to record 
  - To do so log into the zoom meeting and click on “claim host “ button that is shown when you click “Participants”. You’ll be prompted to type in a code key which is available on the internal part of lab website where we keep login info for accounts 
- Pull up session scripts/protocol, Halloween training instructions, and Halloween Test instructions 
- Send *Session 1 Links* email 
  - NOTE: do not add Gorilla Code to LINKS email- code is their MBB # which cannot be paired with private information (participant's name/email) 
  - NOTE: only send parent proxy and parent self REDCap surveys if they indiciated in participant section on redcap that they preferred online survey data collection
- Activate the participant's ID on Gorilla; leave Gorilla open so researcher can track participant progress during behavioral task 
- Prepare Session 1 checklist on REDCap 
- Have the Participant's MBB and secondary MBB number on hand 
- Preload the Consent/Assent picture slideshow on researcher computer 
- Prepare biological sample kits for demonstration during session 
   - hair sample, saliva sample, stool sample

   - link to Consent on REDCap with codes ready 
   - link to recollected surveys on REDCap with codes ready ( if applicable)
