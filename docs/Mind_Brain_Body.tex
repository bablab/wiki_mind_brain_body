The Mind, Brain, Body study looks at how early caregiving experiences influence emotional, cognitive, and brain development, as well as physical health and wellness.

The study also explores how the bacteria that live inside us (the microbiome) are connected to the development of our brains and bodies.

\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

The Mind, Brain, Body (MBB) study examines links between early life adversity (ELA), the gastrointestinal microbiome, memory and affective neurodevelopment, across three years in middle childhood through adolescence. The specific aims of this study are to (1) determine how adversity affects developmental change in the microbiome in middle childhood and adolescence, (2) establish associations between the microbiome, memory development, and the hippocampus, and (3) identify independent and joint influences of adversity exposure, the microbiome, brain and memory performance on the emergence of anxiety symptoms across development. We are recruiting N = 75 ELA exposed, and N = 75 not adversity exposed (Comparison) children and adolescents to take part in 3 waves of data collection. Children in the ELA group must be 6-16 years of age, while children in the comparison group must be 6-9 or 13-16 years of age. Participants complete a laboratory session (in-person or online) in Wave 1-3, and also complete a neuroimaging session in Wave 2. Study procedures for the laboratory session in Wave 1-3 remain similar. For the ELA group, we are recruiting youth who were adopted from institutional or foster care: previously institutionalized and who are now adopted internationally (PI), adopted domestically from foster care (DA). Comparison youth have not experienced these forms of early life caregiving adversities (i.e., they have always been with their biological parents). In addition to the primary aims of the MBB study, described above, we are also collecting a range of supplemental biological, questionnaire, and MRI measures aimed at assessing cognitive and emotional functioning, family functioning, as well as immune, biomarkers, and physical health assessments to aid in understanding the mechanisms behind the specific aims under investigation. The MBB study will test for links between the microbiome, memory, hippocampal function, and anxiety across a three-year time frame in middle childhood -- adolescence (6-16 years of age). Participants may opt out of the study at any point in time but will be asked to participate in testing every year until funding ceases (current grant funding this research -- R00 NIMH -- ends in 2022).

\subsection{Aims}\label{aims}}

The study will test four primary and two supplemental hypotheses. The primary hypotheses are: (H1) that there will be greater stability in microbiome composition across 3 years in the ELA than Comparison group, (H2) ELA will be associated with higher expression of anxiety symptoms across time, (H3) the microbiome in Wave 1 will predict developmental change in memory performance between Wave 1-3, and that hippocampal activity during learning will mediate that association, (H4) that the microbiome, hippocampal encoding patterns, and memory behavior longitudinally mediate the adversity and anxiety association across development. The supplemental hypotheses are: (SH1) that ELA will be associated with a higher incidence of physical health (particularly gastrointestinal) problems, as well as dysregulation in stress response and immune systems, (SH2) that physical symptoms, stress response and immune system will mediate the link between adversity exposure, microbiome changes, hippocampal neurodevelopment, and memory.

\hypertarget{background}{%
\subsection{Background}\label{background}}

An individuals early rearing history has a significant effect on their emotional functioning across the lifespan. In particular, access to consistent/stable caregivers is strongly associated with mental health \citep{repetti_2002}, and parent-related early adversities (e.g., abuse and neglect) contribute to more than a third of mental illnesses \citep[anxiety being the most common diagnosis;][]{kessler_2005}. Clinical, epidemiological and basic science suggests that two systems affected by early adversity -- the gastrointestinal microbiome, and the hippocampal memory system, are also consistently associated with the emergence and maintenance of anxiety symptoms. Rodent and monkey models have established that adversity alters microbial communities in the gut \citep{bailey_1999, bailey_2010, omahony_2009} and that microbial populations are causally related to the expression of anxious behaviors \citep{collins_2013}. In humans too, microbiome-related gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome) and anxiety are highly comorbid \citep{kennedy_2014, callaghan_2019}. In terms of the memory system, rodent studies show that typically weak memories in childhood get stronger following adversity \citetext{\citealp{callaghan_2012a}; \citealp[callaghan\_2012b;][]{cowan_2013}}, and exposure to early stress promotes hippocampal synaptic development \citep{huang_2005}, which aids long-term memory persistence. Memory dysfunction is key to maintaining anxiety disorders, which are characterized by persistent and intrusive memories of threat\citep{acheson_2012, zlomuzica_2014}, and hippocampal dysfunction is common in anxiety disorders \citep{godsil_2013}. Importantly, hippocampal development is causally tied to the microbiome in early life \citep{callaghan_2016, clarke_2013, cowan_2016, gareau_2011}, suggesting that interactions between these two systems could contribute to anxiety emergence. Although microbial and hippocampal memory systems exert their effects on anxiety in the context of one another, until now, they have always been studied independently.

Using a completely novel longitudinal design, we will test the hypothesis that changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome are associated with early adverse caregiving and underlie altered hippocampal development and memory functioning in middle childhood -- adolescence. Moreover, we will examine whether those microbial, and neurodevelopmental changes mediate the progression towards anxiety symptoms in early adversity exposed individuals. To answer these questions, we will compare longitudinal data from a group of adolescents who have experienced early caregiving adversity, to a group of comparison youth who have not experienced those same events. The study will involve examining the gastrointestinal microbiome (measured through stool samples), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to understand hippocampal functional development. In addition, the study will collect saliva and blood spot samples to assess saliva biomarkers (e.g., cortisol, testosterone) and blood immune markers (e.g., CRP, interleukins), as well as hair samples to assess chronic cortisol exposure, which can be used to understand the mechanisms behind microbiome-brain associations in youth.

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\section{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

All youth will be recruited through community settings, clinics (e.g., pediatricians office), specialized services (e.g., adoption services), and through the internet (community boards, targeted advertisements).

Three assessments (spaced 12 months apart -- Wave 1-3) will occur with youth who fall within the period of development in the hippocampal and microbiome: `children', and `adolescents' aged 6-16 years. Biological (stool, saliva, blood spots, hair), questionnaire, and behavioral data will be collected in each wave of the study, and an fMRI scan will be collected in Wave 2. Participants will be recruited who have either experienced early life adversity (ELA) through adverse caregiving (previously institutionalized, domestically adopted), or who have not been exposed to those caregiving experiences (Comparison). A sample size of N = 75 youth will be recruited into each of those groups, resulting in a final target of N = 150 youth in the study (N = 37-38 in each of the age groups = children versus adolescents, for the ELA and Comparison groups at Wave 1). That target sample size takes attrition into account across the longitudinal study (expected at 20\%, to arrive at a final sample size of N = 120). Study procedures for each wave of data collection will be similar, except for Wave 2 where an fMRI scan will occur in a second session. In addition, Wave 1 of data collection was transitioned online due to the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Participants will therefore range in age from 6-16 years at Wave 1, 7-17 years at Wave 2, and 8-20 years at Wave 3. Participants will be recruited through targeted mailout (birth records), online advertising (e.g., Craigslist), school and community organization partnerships, street-fairs and community gathering events, and flyers. After contacting the lab to express interest in study participation, parents of child and adolescent participants are contacted by telephone or email to be screened for study eligibility. An experienced research associate will conduct a scripted telephone interview to assess whether the participant/s meet criteria for inclusion/exclusion. If participants prefer to communicate via email, they will be sent a detailed infographic which contains the same key information communicated in the telephone script. In addition to this informational infographic, in the body of the email, participants will be sent a few brief questions to determine eligibility and basic demographics.

During this initial contact, if eligible and interested, participants will be scheduled for their Wave 1 session and sent the consent and assent forms. They will also be told about Wave 2-3 and that scheduling for those visits will take place approximately 12 and 24 months after Wave 1. Participants involved in any wave will be told that they will be invited to participate in future waves, but are not required to do so. When the study transitions to Wave 2, parents of children and adolescents who participated in Wave 1 will be re-contacted and screened for eligibility in Wave 2 using the same procedure. When the study transitions to Wave 3, parents of children and adolescents who participated in Wave 1 and/or Wave 2 will be re-contacted and screened for eligibility for Wave 3.

\paragraph{Description}\label{description}}

Parents and children participated in a discussion where they were filmed having a conversation. They were presented with a laminated sheet which contained a list of pleasant events on one side and a list of issues on the other side. These lists contained topics and events that children and parents might experience (for example, pleasant events included talking about sports, going to a concert, camping, etc., while issues included cleaning, homework, cleanliness, etc.). Participants were instructed to take 1-minute to choose something on the list and then were given 5-minutes to discuss what they had chosen. They were instructed to try to resolve the conflict and to try to plan the pleasant event. Participants were permitted to expand beyond topics on the list. Participants were filmed during the interaction. The conflict interaction was completed first, and the pleasant event was discussed second to ensure that parents were not thinking about the negative interaction upon completing the clinical interview and questionnaires about their child immediately after the observation. Videos were coded using the Family Interaction Macrocoding System (FIMS)\citep{holmbeck_1995}.

\paragraph{Coding the Interaction}\label{coding-the-interaction}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  After the observation are collected, videos will be coded by two observers blind to the caregiving group of the child (adversity or comparison).
\item
  Videos will be coded using the Family Interaction Macrocoding Schedule (FIMS)\citep{holmbeck_1995}.
\item
  We ultimately decided to go with FIMS for several reasons:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Expense - Approximately \$1000 USD for a 10 hour skype training session with one of Holmbeck's team
  \item
    Validation in age range - FIMS was designed for older children and adolescents, and Sarah Whittle has validated it in a community sample of 8 year olds and their mothers.
  \item
    FIMS is a less intensive coding schedule, producing global codes, rather than micro coded (i.e., minute to minute) scales - which makes more intuitive sense in the age range for MBB.
  \item
    FIMS has a peer version that we might branch out to in the future (but likely not needing further training)\citep{holbein_2014}.
  \item
    Sarah Whittle's group looked at the component structure for the FIMS and found components that seemed close to what they were finding with the Hops LIFE system - namely: negative maternal affect during pleasant event, negative maternal during conflict discussion, and pleasant maternal affect across both tasks (warmth). The negative maternal during pleasant event was the most predictive of child behavior problems. Overall, the correlations they report in their paper are all very sensical and convinced me that we should use the FIMS \citep{richmond_2018}

Child and adolescent participants will have their gastric activity monitored through an EGG. Similar to measures of heart rate, the EGG is collected through small stickers containing recording electrodes that are stuck on the abdomen, and are connected through recording wires to the Biopac machine and then computer. EGG will be measured at the same time as participants heart rate and sweat response (during the computer tasks).

\subsubsection{Memory Intrusion}\label{memory-intrusion}}

\hypertarget{description-1}{%
\paragraph{Description}\label{description-1}}

Child and adolescent participants will listen to a list of words that surround a theme (e.g., for the theme sleep, they might hear -- `pillow', `bed', `night', `tired', `cosy'). There will be a series of words that are conceptually related to the theme that they do not hear (e.g., they will not hear `sleeping'). Then participants are asked to recall the words they heard from the list, and the number of memory intrusions from related but not presented words (i.e., `sleeping') is recorded. Participants will do two versions of this task, one preceded by a relaxing task (neutral movie clips described above), and another preceded by a mild stressor (sad/scary movie clips).

Note that the movie clips are age appropriate and follow film classification guidelines for the child's/adolescent's age (i.e., G-rated movies for the child age group). Such movies might involve scenes like the stampede scene from `The Lion King'.

Physiology Marks - We have inserted start and stop times for the physiology for the movie component of the task, which will be used for one of the analyses. We have also inserted physiology marks for the start and stop times for each of the word lists, and finally for the recall phases.

\emph{Note: Be careful using physiology during the recall phase, as the participant is talking during that phase.}

\hypertarget{halloween}{%
\subsubsection{Halloween}\label{halloween}}

\hypertarget{description-2}{%
\paragraph{Description}\label{description-2}}

The Halloween task is a memory task comprised of both recognition and associative memory components. Children are told that they are going to play a Halloween game. In one block, they see bright and cheery indoor and outdoor scenes, and in the next block the scenes are dark and haunted looking. In addition to these scenes, an item (toy or candy) is overlaid somewhere in the scene. They are told that their job is to collect the toys and sweets and remember what house the toys/candy came from. Each block has 20 trials (10 are the house + toy, 10 are the house + candy). The toys/candy that are paired with the houses are not counterbalanced, but the order of the blocks will be counterbalanced between participants (some will have day then night, and some will have night then day). The context is presented for 500ms before the item is overlaid on the context image for an additional 2500ms (3000ms total). There is a 500ms interstimulus interval between trials. There is a self-advancing break between the blocks.

\hypertarget{background-1}{%
\paragraph{Background}\label{background-1}}

In prior work, across typical development, the research team found that during an associative learning task (contexts paired with objects or faces) there were different levels of granularity in the anterior third versus posterior third of the hippocampus - where representations were more granular in the posterior than anterior and that this granularity increased across age. Although brain data from previously institutionalized youth have not yet been analyzed, we have seen interesting behavior associations with adversity. Specifically, we see an age by adversity interaction on memory retention, where previously institutionalized children have better long-term memory retention, which becomes normalized by adolescence.

To further this line of research, we will continue looking at the association between granularity in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus and long-term memory retention. In this task, we also include a component looking at the role of emotion in processing. To incorporate this, we have one block of the task being emotional or threatening in some way -- the contexts (scenes) will be either scary or not scary. The idea for this task comes from several papers \citep{brunec_2018, lambert_2019, tambini_2010}.

\hypertarget{details-2}{%
\paragraph{Details}\label{details-2}}

The idea from this task comes from four papers:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \citet{tambini_2010} - enhanced brain correlations at rest are associated with long term memory. Based on the results of this paper, Callaghan, Tottenham and Davachi developed the task that Bridget subsequently used for the K99 grant. See details below.
\item
  \citet{brunec_2018} - Multiple scales of representation along the hippocampal anteroposterior axis in humans. The analysis used in this paper - representational granularity - we adopted for my K99 project.
\item
  Results of the K99 project - in the K99, across typical development, we found that during an associative learning task (contexts paired with objects or faces) there were different levels of granularity in the anterior third vs.~posterior third of the hippocampus - where representations were more granular in the posterior than anterior and that this granularity increased across age. Although we have not yet analyzed the brain in PI youth, we have seen interesting behavior associations with adversity. Specifically, we see an age x adversity interaction on memory retention, where PI children have better long term memory retention, which becomes normalized by adolescence.
\item
  \citet{lambert_2019} - altered development of hippocampus dependent associative learning following early life adversity. In this paper they found that adversity (violence exposed youth) were impaired in hippocampus associative memory only when the item (faces) were angry. That is, when threat cues were present, they suggested that is hijacked encoding and made more elemental and less context integrated.
\end{enumerate}

In the R00, I wanted to continue looking at the association between granularity in the anterior vs.~posterior hippocampus and long term memory retention. However, rather than do the exact same task as the in the K99, I wanted to include a component that looked at the role of emotion in processing. One way to do this is doing the same item + context task as I did during the K99, but having one of the runs of the task being emotional or threatening in some way.

Idea for the halloween game:

Items will be toys and sweets, and the contexts will either be scary or not scary. This is different than the Lambert study in that her contexts were neutral and the items (i.e., faces) were angry or not. So therefore the scary item prevented the processing of the context. In this version, the context will be scary and the item will be neutral - so will the context hijack the processing and make the scary run harder for adversity exposed kids to learn the association? Or will it be the opposite, heightening attention and improving learning?

Structure of the game:
Children will be told that they are going to play a halloween game. In one run, they will see bright and cheery indoor and outdoor scenes, and in the next run the scenes will be dark and haunted looking. They will be told that their job is to collect the toys and sweets and remember what house the toys/sweets came from.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/information/measures/tasks/halloween/1.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

This is the basic structure of each block. First there is a fixation cross for 1 second, then a house will appear on the screen for 500ms, then the house+toy/sweets will appear on the screen for an addition 2.5 seconds (total of 3 seconds for the house and the house+toy/sweet, then there will be a baseline period that is jittered in length. The baseline is jittered in the MRI but it will be a fixed length of 1 seconds in the lab-based version of the task. In the MRI the active baseline will involve pressing buttons to indicate the direction of arrows on the screen, in the lab-based version of the task, it involves simply looking at a fixation dot.

There will be two blocks (day, and night). The day block is the emotionally neutral block, whereas the night block is the scary block. Each block has 20 trials (10 are the house + toy, 10 are the house + sweets). The toys/sweets that are paired with the houses are not counterbalanced, but the order of the blocks will be counterbalanced between participants (some will have day then night, and the rest will have night then day).

As an added layer to this task, we will not only pair an item with a house, but we will place it on top of the house in one quadrant. To encode a detailed associative memory, the individual will need to remember what item was paired with the house and then what quadrant it was in. For this test, a picture of a house will be shown along with 3 choices for which item matches with the house, one being correct and 2 serving as filler ``foils.'' The two ``foil'' options are items from other houses, so the child will have seen them before. Each item will both be a correct answer for the house it was initially paired with and a foil answer for two other houses throughout the trial. Additionally, the child will have to recall which quadrant the selected item was in on the house. The quadrants appear

For the recognition test there should be an equal number of foils as target items.

\hypertarget{characters-monstersaliens}{%
\subsubsection{Characters (monsters/aliens)}\label{characters-monstersaliens}}

\hypertarget{description-3}{%
\paragraph{Description}\label{description-3}}

Participants are instructed that their job in this game is to learn which ``character'' is right and which is wrong through trial-and-error. Participants are presented two stimuli side-by-side for 3500 milliseconds and indicate which character they choose by using the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard. Stimuli are presented in pairs AB, CD, EF (and their counterbalanced version BA, DC, FE). Stimuli A is correct in the AB/BA trials 80\% of the time. Stimuli C is correct in the CD/DC trials 70\% of the time. Stimuli E is correct in the EF/FE trials 60\% of the time. Stimuli are randomly shuffled and assigned a letter at the beginning of the task. For Mind, Brain, Body, the stimuli consisted of colorful monsters/aliens.

If participants choose ``correctly'' they will see a green check mark and hear ``ding'' sound. If they choose ``incorrectly'' they will see a red x mark and hear a ``horn'' sound. If they take longer than 3500 milliseconds to respond, they are shown a screen that says ``Too Slow''. All feedback is presented for 2000 milliseconds before moving on to the next trial. Stimuli pairs are presented 10 times each in random order in each block (total of 60 trials). PsychoPy tallies the correct and incorrect responses on a block-by-block basis. Participants move onto the test phase once they have reached a performance criterion (65\% accuracy for AB/BA trials, 60\% accuracy for CD/DC trials, 50\% accuracy for EF/FE trials). If participants do not reach criterion, they are automatically directed to the test after reaching a certain number of blocks (3 for children, 5 for adolescents).

During the test, participants are presented with all training pairs (AB/BA, CD/DC, EF/FE), and novel pairs including A and B (AC/CA, AD/DA, AE/EA, AF/FA, BC/CB, BD/DB, BE/EB, BF/FB). Test pairs are each presented 6 times. This section is untimed, and no feedback is provided.

\hypertarget{background-2}{%
\paragraph{Background}\label{background-2}}

The characters task assesses learning. It is a cognitive reinforcement learning task in which participants must learn to choose one stimulus over another through reinforcement. Participants can employ two strategies to learn the correct response---either they can learn to choose stimulus `A' or to avoid stimulus `B'. At test, these stimuli are paired with novel stimuli. If participants choose stimulus `A' over the novel stimulus, that is evidence of positive feedback learning. If participants choose the novel stimulus over stimulus `B', that is evidence of negative feedback learning. As a result, this task allows for direct comparison of sensitivity to these two types of learning \citep{frank_2004}.

\subsubsection{Discrimination / Conditioning / Extinction}\label{discrimination-conditioning-extinction}}

\hypertarget{description-4}{%
\paragraph{Description}\label{description-4}}

Children and adolescent participants will take part in a visual perceptual threshold task. Participants will be shown visual stimuli (e.g., two black stripes at different orientations, or two Gabors with different levels of contrast) and asked to discriminate between them: ``which stripe is rotated more clockwise 1 or 2?'' for the stripes, or
``which picture is darker/clearer 1 or 2?'' for the Gabors. The magnitude of the difference between the two choices will be decreased after two correct choices, and increased after one correct choice, and will be continued until 6 wrong choices are made. The smallest magnitude where participants were able to correctly identify the stripe or Gabor in question is their Just Noticeable Difference (JND) threshold. The JND will be calculated before and after the threat learning task, and after the extinction task.

\hypertarget{details-4}{%
\paragraph{Details}\label{details-4}}

This task has two purposes.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The first is to simply look at threat learning and extinction in children and adolescents across typical development and after adversity exposure. This has been done many times before, but we will also have children attached to an electrogastrogram (EGG - which is completely novel), GSR (sweat - which is the common measure), and heart rate (which is somewhat common but less so in the conditioning literature) while they and learning and extinguishing.
\item
  The second purpose of the task is to look at how conditioning and extinction affect perceptual thresholds. This is built from a large literature in adults showing that threat learning can lead to a broadening or narrowing of tuning curves following threat conditioning, depending on the specific parameters in place (more narrowing - i.e., better, occurs when a discriminatory conditioning procedure is employed and where the CS- and the CS+ and really different; more broadening occurs when the CS- and the CS+ are similar and when there is not explicit discriminative conditioning. We are going to employ a form of conditioning that has been shown to lead to perceptual broadening in adults.
\end{enumerate}

Past literature:
This paper by \citet{shalev_2018} demonstrates the effect we are trying to test in children/adolescents. They use an across sensory modality procedure (CSs = auditory, USs = visual) and between subjects design (control group = CS+ are positive/neutral, and experiments group where CS+ are negative) with pre/post perceptual tuning curves to determine the effect of threat learning on sensory discrimination.

The basic task structure:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/information/measures/tasks/disc_cond_ext/1.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

The task and results:

They find that when the CS+ is paired with the aversive picture, people show a deterioration in their ability to discriminate the CS+ from tones that are similar to it, whereas they show very little change in their ability to discriminate the CS- from tones that are similar to it. They saw the same thing with gabors that differed in contrast (right) and lines that differed in orientation (left).

\includegraphics{images/information/measures/tasks/disc_cond_ext/3.png}
\includegraphics{images/information/measures/tasks/disc_cond_ext/4.png}

Current Task Structure:

We will use an approach where we pair aversive/pleasant noises (USs) with lines at different orientations (CSs). In the control group the noise will be pleasant or neutral. In the experimental group the noise will be aversive.

\begin{figure}

The timeline of the task will be as follows:

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Number of trials was based on review of five papers \citetext{\citealp[ (56 trials)]{norrholm_2011}; \citealp[ (72 trials)]{norrholm_2006}; \citealp[ (32 trials)]{schiller_2013}; \citealp[ (34 trials)]{phelps_2004}; \citealp{jovanovic_2014}}.
\end{itemize}

The experimental protocol consisted of two phases: fear acquisition and extinction. The sessions were separated by 10 minutes. The acquisition phase consisted of 3 blocks, each with 3 CS+ trials, 3 CS− trials, and 3 noise alone (NA, no CS presented during startle probe) trials, for a total of 27 startle trials. Both CSs were colored shapes presented on a computer monitor for 6000 ms prior to the delivery of the startle probe, and co-terminated with the US 500 ms after the presentation of the startle stimulus. The CS+ was reinforced with the airblast 100\% of the time. The extinction phase consisted of 4 blocks with 3 trials of each type. The CSs were same as above, except that the CS+ was no longer paired with the airblast. In all phases of the experiment, inter-trial intervals will be randomized between 9 and 22 seconds.

Child and adolescent participants will donate a head hair sample for the purpose of measuring average cortisol levels during the past month. To collect the sample, a few strands of hair behind the crown of the head will be cut close to the root. This method of collecting hair is not invasive and has been performed in babies \citep[32 weeks of age;][]{staufenbiel_2013}. Hair samples will never be used for genetic analysis.

\hypertarget{saliva-sample}{%
\subsubsection{Saliva sample}\label{saliva-sample}}

Saliva samples will be collected from child and adolescent participants in the lab using omnigene oral tubes (dnagenotek). Participants spit into a tube using a saliva collection kit. If participants are unable to spit, they will place small sterilized sponges in their mouths to collect the saliva. The sponges are then placed into the tube. After the cap of the tube is closed, it will break open a seal inside that releases a stabilizing solution into the tube which stabilizes the saliva. The saliva will be used to analyze bacteria in the oral cavity. The stabilization technique we use allows the saliva samples to remain at ambient temperature for several months. In batches, the saliva will sent to the processing facility. The samples will be labelled with participant ID codes only -- no personally identifying information. Only microbial DNA, not human DNA, is analyzed in these samples.

\hypertarget{blood-sample}{%
\subsubsection{Blood sample}\label{blood-sample}}

Dried Blood Spot Collection: Participants can opt into or out of participating in the dried blood spot collection (identified during the consent process). Those who opt into the blood spot collection will have one finger on their non¬dominant hand pricked in order to provide approximately ten drops of blood that will be placed on special filter paper cards and examined for circulating and molecular markers of inflammation. We will not collect blood from participants who are feeling ill or participants who take anticoagulants or blood thinners (e.g.~Heparin, Warfarin -- verified through medication checklist). Participants will be offered a Virtual Reality (VR) immersive headset to watch a video during the blood spot procedure. Previous studies have empirically demonstrated that VR can significantly reduce child/adolescent anxiety about blood spot/draw procedures. The trained researcher will massage the finger to be pricked to draw the blood circulation to that area, and will use BD Microtainer contact-activated lancets to make one prick the middle or ring finger on the non-dominant hand, disposing of the lancet in a bio¬hazard sharps container immediately. This procedure is similar to what children/adolescent may experience at a pediatrician visit. Five drops of blood are placed onto each of two Whatman 903 Proteinsaver cards (GE Healthcare Bio¬Sciences). After collection, the finger will be cleaned (with an alcohol swab), dried with gauze, and bandaged. Blood spot samples will be dried overnight, then closed, labeled with ID number and date, and stored in a small plastic bag with a desiccant pack. Bags are stored in -¬80 Celsius freezer until shipped for further processing. When shipped for further processing, the bags are placed in an insulated box with dry ice before being transported for analysis. Blood test results are not diagnostic and will not be shared with study participants. Risks of the procedure include temporary soreness at the site of the finger prick, or in very rare circumstances, infection. To minimize the risk of infection, we will follow sterile procedures, including the use of sterile, one-time-use lancets, sterile gauze/bandage, and alcohol wipes of the site. Blood will be collected in the Health Psychology Lab in Franz or in the SAND lab in Franz, which has a drape to maintain cleanliness of the collection area, a sharps container, as well as antibacterial cleaning materials to maintain cleanliness of the collection room. Experimenters performing the needle prick will wear gloves throughout the procedure and wear covered clothing as a safety precaution. The non¬dominant hand will be used and bandaged to avoid soreness from overuse at the site of the finger prick. If there is no blood, or not sufficient blood on the first finger prick, a second prick will be attempted on a different finger to avoid unnecessary discomfort. Experimenters performing the finger prick will be trained and certified in dried blood spot collection.

\hypertarget{stool-sample}{%
\subsubsection{Stool sample}\label{stool-sample}}

A stool sample will be collected from the child and adolescent participants in their home with the assistance of their parent using omnigene gut tubes (dnagenotek). Using a regular toilet, participants use the paper toilet hat to catch the stool. Participants will use a small sterile spatula to collect a pea sized amount of stool from the toilet hat and place it in the tube. After the lid is sealed, with the sample inside, the participant will shake the tube. A homogenization bead inside will break up the sample and cover all of the sample with a stabilizing liquid. The participant will place the stool sample into a biohazard bag, into a padded mailer, which will be returned to the lab through the registered post. The stabilization technique we use allows the stool samples to remain at ambient temperature for several weeks. Once the sample arrives at the lab, it will be placed into the locked -80 Celcius freezer until processing. Once all samples are collected we will pack the samples in dry ice and send to the processing facility. The samples will be labelled with participant ID codes only -- no personally identifying information. Only microbial DNA, not human DNA, is analyzed in these samples.

Note: On Nov 16, 2020 there was a product change notification sent by DNA Genotek regarding the OMNIgene•GUT (OM/R-200, OM/R-200.100) and PERFORMAbiome•GUT (PB-200) devices. In brief, DNA Genotek removed ``Made in Canada'' from their packaging and updated the lot information (reflected in the barcode), to allow for an increase in manufacturing sites sand production lots sizes. This is to note that different sites may have made the omnigene packages we use in different study waves.

Once the parent and child/teen come into the lab, seat them in the Rainbow Room on the couch for consenting (parent) and assenting (child aged 7+ or teen).

Make some small talk - Ask the participant how they got here. If they have participated before in research. Offer them a bottle of water. Thank them for coming and for giving up their weekend to help science.

Tell the parent and child that the first thing you are going to do is go over all of the things they will do today, and have them sign the consent and assent forms.

Speak to them and direct them through the whole process.

\subsection{W1 Protocol - Parent/Child Observation}\label{w1-protocol---parentchild-observation}}

The parent and child will be in the Rainbow Room for 15 minutes. During that time they will be filmed while planning a conflict event, and then again while discussing a pleasant event. The conflict event will always go first, followed by the pleasant event. We did this to ensure that the parents were not thinking of the negative interaction upon answering the questionnaires about their child, which they did immediately after the observation interaction. Participants should complete this activity in English.

\textbf{Step 1}:

Parent and child will be situated on the grey couch in the Rainbow Room. The iPad video camera will be placed about 4 feet away from the dyad, on a tripod stand. The screen of the iPad will be facing away from the parent and child.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Step 2}:

The researcher will give the parent and child the Pleasant Events Checklist (PEC) on a piece of paper.

\emph{Researcher: Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss a source of conflict (or something you disagree on) and try to resolve it. On this piece of paper is a list of things that parents and children sometimes have disagreements about. Please take a moment to read the list and think about some that you would like to discuss together. When I knock on the door, please start discussing the things you have selected from the list and try to resolve the areas of conflict you have chosen from the list. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from the list, or decide to choose something else not included on the list. I will give you five minutes to discuss the event, then I will come back and give you further instructions.}

\textbf{Step 3}:

Researcher press record on the iPad and leave the room. Start timer for 1 minute, then knock on the door and ask the dyad to begin discussing their event. Start timer for 5 minutes. At the end of 5 minutes, again knock on the door and enter the Rainbow Room.

\emph{Researcher: Thank you for taking the time to discuss the source of conflict and try to resolve it. Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss a pleasant event you could do together. On this piece of paper is a list of events that parents and children sometimes find pleasant to do together. Please take a moment to read the list of events and think about what you would like to plan to do together. When I knock on the door, please start discussing the event you would like to do together and make a plan for how you could do it. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from the list, or decide to choose something else not included on the list. I will give you five minutes to discuss the event, then I will come back and give you further instructions.}

\textbf{Step 4}:

Researcher press record on the iPad and leave the room. Start timer for 1 minute, then knock on the door and ask the dyad to begin discussing their event. Start timer for 5 minutes. At the end of 5 minutes, again knock on the door and enter the Rainbow Room.

\textbf{Step 5}:

Researcher reenter the room, switch the iPad off and move the child/adolescent to their next session.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Simultaneously press play on the movie on the laptop while also pressing the spacebar on the psychopy task. This will start the physiology and the movie at about the same time. While the movie is playing there will be a box of popcorn on the computer screen.
\item
  When the movie is done, press spacebar on the psychopy computer to progress to the next screen. Read the instructions for the participant:
\item
  Click on the face that shows how you feel after watching the movies.
\item
  Participants can use a mouse to click on the face that matches the way they feel after watching the movie. The faces range in valence (negative to positive) across the X axis, and arousal (low to high) up the Y axis.
\item
  After the participant has selected a face, you will be taken to the next screen where you can read the instructions for the participants:

  \emph{Listen to the list of words and try to remember all of them.}
\item
  When the participant indicates that they have understood the instructions, press the spacebar and progress to the next screen. Make sure that the computer volume is up and the participant can hear the words being pronounced on the computer screen. After the participant hears all the words the distractor task will start.
\item
  Read the distractor task instructions to the participant:

  \emph{Count backwards from the number 25 out loud for the researcher.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note: Whether the participant completes the distractor task correctly or not doesn't matter. The only purpose of the distractor task is to distract the participant for a brief period of time. Listen while they count backwards. If they can't count backwards, ask them to count forwards.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When the participant is finished counting backwards from 25, or after approximately 30s has passed (whatever comes first), progress to the next screen by pressing the spacebar.
\item
  Read the instructions out loud to the participant:

  \emph{Recall 1. Please tell the researcher all the words that you can remember from the list.}
\item
  Before the participant starts to tell you what they remember, start a new voice recording and then tell them to start while you record what they say (on the talk setting). Also write what they say on a piece of paper. Make sure to note that this is `Recall 1' (as there is a second recall later on). When the participant has told you all the words they can remember, or after 60s, progress to the next screen (instructions for the next word list).
\item
  Make one recording for all of the memory intrusion task
\item
  Read the instructions aloud for the participant.

  \emph{Now you will hear another word list. Get ready!}
\item
  Press the spacebar to hear the word list. After the word list, move to the distractor task (counting backwards from 25). After the distractor task, move to the second recall task and record the participant like the first. When the second recall task is complete, a new loop will begin. Read the instructions to the participant then start the next movie (which will always be neutral). Repeat everything again for the final loop after they watch the final movie, which will either be sad or scary.

\subsection{W1-O Checklist - Scheduling Stage}\label{w1-o-checklist---scheduling-stage}}

\textbf{Calling participants from REDCap}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Participants can be considered ``lost to follow up'' if they meet all of the following criteria:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Researcher has tried to contact individual at different times of day.
  \item
    Researcher has used at least 2 different approaches (e.g.~email and phone), UNLESS only 1 form of contact has been given, in which case participant should fully meet all other criteria.
  \item
    Person has been contact at least 4 times.
  \item
    Situation is NOT considered ``phone tag'' (a participant calls and lab member returns call but keeps missing one another- this shows participant may still be interested, therefore number of contact and lack of response may not be due to lack of interest. Participants in ``phone tag'' situation should stay on contact list).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Waitlist criteria}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This regards the ``out of town'' option on the wave1\_Status on REDCap
\item
  Should include:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    any participants here live outside of LA, and won't be coming back to LA (e.g.~did not relocate just for COVID-19 pandemic purposes)
  \item
    participants whose age tally exceed 10, the target collection number for each age group in our age range. Refer to the \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/724688028024}{Participant Tally} for reference.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{PLEASE NOTE: Participants who have not aged out yet, or who are not free at the moment yet, OR live outside the US but plan to come back as soon as the pandemic is over should all still be kept on the contact log and just have a future recontact date. We only want to put people who are going on our ``out of town'' waitlist (like a plan B, only contact if necessary)!}

We will only refer to the waitlist if (1) we will be behind on recruitment for Wave 1 and will need to just schedule people who we know cannot come back for future waves to complete data collection or (2) we will be behind on recruitment for Wave 1 and will need to just schedule people who are anywhere within our age range, rather than targeted numbers by age to complete data collection (3) we have to stay in the pandemic and all future waves will be remote.

\textbf{Important Reminders}

\textbf{Screening}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Check participant tally before screening to know if we would be scheduling or waitlisting if they qualify
\item
  When answering the call ask who you are speaking with ( so we know if it's a parent or teen)
\item
  If a potential participant is not of age then put their recontact to future around the time they would qualify
\item
  If screening a family with multiple children each child has to be screened with their own smbb

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Oldest child gets next available smbb number just like the mbb number protocol
  \item
    Only exception is if we only knew about younger child then during screening mentions they have another child that wants to participate.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Triple check you write down the address correctly for participants ( repeat it back to them / spell it out)
\item
  Do not run session until you are 100\% sure they are eligible. If unsure of a criteria verify it before session.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Calendar}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Put the W1 for wave one ( e.g.~S1 W1 ) on session events
\item
  For reminder emails put Status: Incomplete in description
\item
  For Session 1 Reminder 1 call event put ``Only if no email response'' in the description and then status: Incomplete
\item
  Whenever you complete a reminder event mark it as complete and update the MBB participant log
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Emails to participant}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Move potential participant email to ``Added'' tab of MBB once you add them to the participant database
\item
  All emails to a participant should be in the same thread

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The thread we initially contacted them at should be the one we send the session confirmation to

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \textbf{Remember that email templates need to be edited}(e.g.~there are no written responses in wave 2 so that chunk should be deleted, there is no ASA in wave 1 so that should be deleted in wave 1, etc.)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The easiest way to not forget steps is to do all `` session has just been scheduled'' tasks based on the MBB log
\item
  Make sure you are sending the correct reminder email - S1 R2 is the one with the researcher card
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Confirming sessions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do not put as `` confirmed session'' on MBB log unless we got verbal confirmation / email confirmation
\item
  If called and no answer leave a note on the calendar event saying was not able to verbally confirm \& also put into SRA chat
\end{itemize}

\textbf{REDCap}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Log into REDCap with your own account to avoid confusion and for easier identification of who screened each smbb participant
\item
  After contacting someone change the Wave status ``date to recontact'' to one week from the current date ( can be two weeks if it's someone that hasn't responded in long time)
\item
  When you schedule a new MBB participant change their SMBB ``Wave 1 status'' to enrolled
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Scheduling and Confirmation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Schedule session 1 two weeks in advance from ``package mailing day'' (see package preparation in pre-session checklist)
\item
  Schedule session 2 \textasciitilde{}one week after session 1
\item
  Ask Lab Manager to make Zoom link with scheduled session times and save to google calendar
\item
  Send session 1 confirmation email (in templates)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Attach \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/665452959932}{Next Steps}, \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/680632734387}{Computer Zoom Download Instructions}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Enrollment}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create participant Box folder using MBB\_template (delete blank README from newly created folder)
\item
  Enroll participant in Wave 1 on REDCap

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Go to ``Add / Edit Records'' of MBB
  \item
    Make sure the tab is ``Arm 2: wave 1''
  \item
    Type in the next available MBB
  \item
    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Be careful because any premature clicking makes a new ID*
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Fill participant instrument on REDCap

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Age should be the age of participant at the time of \emph{Session 1} }
  \item
    In notes section add the date and time of session
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Update \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/724688028024}{Participant Tally}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Calendar}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create MBB Session 1/2 calendar events (and invite researcher)

\textbf{General Notes about calendar}

Session 1 reminders

\begin{itemize}
\item
  You can differentiate the Session 1 Reminder 1 and Reminder 2 emails by seeing if it says to include Research Profile ( reminder 2 is the one with the researcher profile)
\item
  the files you attach to the emails are in BABLAB/Studies/Mind\_Brain\_Body/Documents/Infographic\_next\_steps/Wave\_1\_online
\item
  consents are in BABLAB/Studies/Mind\_Brain\_Body/Documents/Consents/Wave\_1\_online
\item
  Research profiles are in BABLAB/Studies/Mind\_Brain\_Body/Documents/Infographic\_next\_steps and remember to drag the picture in show it shows up in the email body
\item
  When you call you're just asking them to confirm that the session date and time works for them \& that they received package/ *Hi this is \_\_\_\_ from the Brain and Body Lab. I am calling to confirm you are still available for your session on \_\_\_. Also, have you received the package?*
\end{itemize}

Session 2 Reminders

\begin{itemize}
\item
  You can check if they consented to stool sample by looking at email thread to see the session @ confirmation email the researcher sent them OR you can go to their Session 1 checklist on REDCap
\item
  Make sure you only include relevant reminders in the email, delete the highlighted parts that don't apply to them
\end{itemize}

Home Session Reminders

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Check the MBB participant log to see if we haev received their package.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If the Package COnfirmation section is filled out as complete then we \emph{have} received package.
  \item
    Lab manager also sends message to SRA to update on packages that are received so can search chat
  \item
    If still unsure if participant has sent package back to us check email thread
  \end{itemize}
\item
  For home session reminders make sure to only send request if they haven't sent package back or are missing something

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If we \emph{did} receive package but something is missing ( contact list, BSS) then you would request it. Lab manager usually tells whoever is in charge of calendar if things were missing from packages that were received
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Misc Notes

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If the calendar event is for something else such as checking in with a participapant or rescheduling a session the lab manager or other memmber of team will provide the necessary context
\item
  If unsure about a particicular calendar event you can slack Lab manager or send a message to SRA to see if someone knows answer
\item
  Remember to mark as complete on calendar and on MBB participant log after doing each calendar event
\item
  refer to Wave 2 Checklist for script for the text message if it is not in the description of calendar event

{[}ONCE ZOOM IS CONNECTED{]}

\emph{Hi! Thank you so much for joining us today! We are so looking forward to today's session with you. Usually, when we conduct a study such as this, we would do it our lab at UCLA. However, with COVID-19 we've decided it would be safer to carry out this study online for the time being- social distancing and all!}

\emph{Our session today should take around 2 hours long. In addition to what we do here today, there will be a follow up zoom appointment with us one week from now. At that appointment, we will reconnect on a second Zoom call in which your child will log on for 15 minutes and complete a computer game.}

\emph{So first, I'll just ask- have you ever used Zoom before?}

{[}If yes, say{]} \emph{Great! So you are probably familiar with the different functions here, but I will just give you a little refresher on some buttons we will need for today. The most important thing you need to be aware of is the ``chat'' button below. If you click on it, a chat box should open- I will be using this throughuot the session to send you imporant links. You may already know this, but you can also display your camera so that it is in gallery view or speaker view in the top right corner. I think it might be best for you to do speaker view so it will feel more like we are in the room together!}

{[}If no, say{]} \emph{No problem! Welcome to Zoom- it is very easy to use! The most important thing you need to be aware of is the ``chat'' button below. If you click on it, a chat box should open- I will be using this throughuot the session to send you imporant links. You can also display your camera so that it is in gallery view or speaker view in the top right corner. I think it might be best for you to do speaker view so it will feel more like we are in the room together!}

{[}Troubleshooting\ldots{}{]}

\emph{Great! If for any reason, we lose each other over Zoom, the connection seems to be bad, or one of us freezes, lets leave the session and try to reconnect on the same link again. If I am frozen- feel free to leave and come back. If you leave and I don;t see you come back, I will try to give you a phone call!}

\emph{How does that sound? Do you have any questions?}

{[}If no, say{]} \emph{Great! Lets switch gears and talk a little bit about what we are going to do today. Let me just pull up a little presentation we have got!}

{[}Researcher to open up the \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/729637683371?sb=/activity}{MBB\_Consent\_Script\_Presentation}{]}

\hypertarget{w1-o-protocol---consent-assent-online}{%
\subsection{W1-O Protocol - Consent \& Assent Online}\label{w1-o-protocol---consent-assent-online}}

\emph{Before we begin, I just wanted to let you know that in this study, we ask a lot of questions about family life and tough things that might have happened to kids. We are going to ask these questions to you and we ask a couple to your children as well, we just want to let you know that it is in our protocol to make sure everyone is safe, so if you or your child reveals to us that you're at current risk of harm or if you're at risk of harming someone else, then we will follow up with you and make sure everything is okay. If it is not, then we will take some steps to make sure that we keep everyone safe.}

\emph{First thing we are going to do is go over what is on the consent and assent forms. (These are the attached documents we sent you in the emails leading up to this session.) We will walk through, in a little bit more detail, all of the things we will be doing during today's session.}

\emph{During today's online session we are going to be doing some interactive things. First, we are going to have you and your parent sit and talk about some not so fun things and some fun things while on ZOOM. This conversation will be recorded but we will not be watching or listening in}

\emph{Next, we are going to have you play a game on the computer. In this game, you will be looking at pictures. Some of the pictures will be a bit scary, some sad, others a bit boring. While you are playing this game, your parent will stay with you in the room but will be working on some surveys to fill out.}

\emph{After the game is over, your parent {[}NAME{]} will help measure your height, weight, and waist circumference.}

\emph{You will also be answering some surveys (for children) with the researcher OR (for teens) on your own.}

\emph{Lastly for today, your parent will help take two biological samples during this session.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  One is the hair sample which helps measure hormones that everyone has in their hair
\item
  Two is the split sample which helps tell us learn a little bit more about your microbiome
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do you know what a microbiome is?
\item
  A microbiome is all the little bacteria that live inside your mouth. Everyone has these, they are healthy! We just want to know what kind and how many of each there are.
\end{itemize}

\emph{For helping us out in today's session, you will be getting \$45 for the work you put in! After this online session is over, we'll ask you to do three more things in the second session:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  One is the Child poop sample -- this helps us learn a bit more about your microbiome
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are also little bacteria that live in your tummy! Everyone has these and we want to know more about them.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Two is filling out the stool scale -- this is a short scale that gives a description of your sample
\item
  Three is the computer memory game -- this is when you will log back on with us via ZOOM in a week's time to see what you remember from today's session
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Great! Do you have any questions for us about any of the samples}

\emph{When you complete the poop sample and the computer game as apart of Session 2, we will pay you another \$20!}

\emph{We will send the full payment of \$65 (\$45 for today's session and \$20 for completing the Session 2) as soon as we receive the samples back through the mail.}

\emph{Here are some things to keep in mind:}

\emph{You are a volunteer in this study, which means you do not have to do anything, or say anything, that makes you uncomfortable. We would like you to try everything you can, and to do your best, but if there are things you absolutely do not want to do, just tells us, that is o.k.}

\emph{Another thing we want to remind you is that nothing you do today is a TEST!! We want you to try your best, but there is no ``right'' or ``wrong'' answers in anything you do today. We just want to learn about you!}

\emph{We will keep your participation confidential. You are given an ID number in order to keep your data confidential and separated from your name. Therefore, any identifying information (like your name, email, address, etc.) will be kept private and not paired with your data. We will also use a secondary ID number to save the videos with (since your faces are in it), which will help separate this from your name and the other data we collect form you. Only members of our research team will have access to your name and ID numbers.}

\emph{I will rename your ``ZOOM Name'' right now with your Secondary ID number, to prepare for the recordings we will take in our session today}

{[}Researcher will rename the participant's name to ``P'' for participant. \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/1.png}

\emph{Ok- I will now send you a link through the Zoom chat, which will open up a survey that allows you to virtually indicate your consent to participate in the study. Please feel free to take your time reading through the consent and assent forms now if you'd like. As I mentioned earlier, these are the documents we had previously sent you in the emails leading up to today's session.}

{[}Then once they are done reading through{]}

\emph{All set and any questions?}

{[}IF NO,{]} \emph{Please click to indicate yours and your child's consent/assent and verbally let us know each of the items you have consented/not consented for, so we can adjust the session in case there is something you/your child may not feel up for today!}

\emph{You may press submit once you are finished to ``send in the form.''}

Researcher to grab magic box.

\emph{Once you are all set with that, we'd like you for to grab the magic box we sent you in the mail. This contains everything you will need for today's session and what you will do as apart of Session 2 as well.}

\emph{If you haven't already done so, please open the magic box up. The magic box should contain a sheet of paper at the top which details all of the contents, but we will let you know when you need to take each item out of the box. Please set aside the magic box for now but keep the materials near you as we may need to access materials from the magic box throughout today's session!}

\emph{What you can pull out now and use throughout the session is the Reward Board and Gold Star Stickers. Use this reward board to track all the steps you accomplish today! Each space is like each task for the session. Once you complete the task you can put a gold star on the space!}

\emph{Are you ready to get started on the session? Great, lets dive in!}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{w1-o-protocol---parent-child-observation-online}{%
\subsection{W1-O Protocol - Parent Child Observation Online}\label{w1-o-protocol---parent-child-observation-online}}

The parent and child will be seated together in view on the Zoom camera. During that time they will be filmed while solving a conflict, and then again while discussing a pleasant event. The conflict event will always go first, followed by the pleasant event. We did this to ensure that the parents were not thinking of the negative interaction upon answering the questionnaires about their child, which they did immediately after the observation interaction.

{[}RESEARCHER SHOULD ASSESS VOLUME. If participant volume is too low, recording will not pick it up. Ensure that volume is at an appropriate frequency before proceeding to PC interaction recordings.{]}

{[}RESEARCHER SHOULD CHANGE TO SPEAKER VIEW. Participants should be in speaker view so recording will enlarge the parent and child for behavior analysis.{]}

Step 1:
The researcher will ask the parent to find the \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/630327764749}{Pleasant/Unpleasant Events Checklist} piece of paper from their session package.

\emph{Researcher: So the first thing we will have you pull out of the magic box is the paper packet titled ``Session 1 Booklet.'' You can flip to the page that says ``Issues Checklist.''}

Researcher will wait for the participant to find the Online Session Booklet and flip to the correct page.

\emph{Researcher: Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss something that's hard and try to resolve it. On this piece of paper (Issues Checklist) is a list of things that parents and children sometimes have disagreements about. We will give you a moment to read the list and think about some that you would like to discuss together. Then after about one minute, you will start discussing the things you have selected and try to resolve them. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from this list, or decide to choose something else. Please choose something you can try to resolve not an emotionally charged topic that would be difficult to discuss together right now. And we want you to remember- this is not a test and there are no right or wrong things to say!}

\emph{I am going to turn off my camera and mute myself to be out of the recording, and I will also turn my volume on low and will not be listening in closely. I will come back in and let you know when the six minutes are all done! If possible, make sure any other children are not in the room. As a reminder please make sure you are both visible on the screen and that you speak loud enough for the microphone to register it.}

\emph{When you are ready, I will begin the recording and give you a total of 6 minutes- one minute or so to choose, then five mimnutes to discuss! Are you ready?}

Step 2:
- Researcher will ensure Zoom security settings are set up for the video.
- Parent and child will be situated side-by-side in view on the Zoom camera.
-Researcher will press record on the Zoom application. \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/3.png} Wait to hear the audio Zoom confirmation \emph{``this meeting is now being recorded''} and view recording in progress at top left of screen to ensure recording is live. \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/4.png}
- Researcher set timer for 6 minute1

Step 3:
- Researcher will mute themselves on Zoom and turn off their camera, and step out of the room.
- Researcher will start timer for 6 minutes. At the end of 6 minutes, reenter camera view and unmute themselves.

{[}After 5 minutes have passed, say{]} \emph{Thank you for taking the time to discuss something difficult. Next we are going to take some film of you talking about something nice. You can now flip to the page that says ``Pleasant Events Checklist''. On your ``Pleasant Events Checklist'' is a list of fun things that parents and children sometimes do together. I will give you a moment to read the list and pick something that you would like to plan to do together. Then after about one minute, you will start discussing the things you have selected and try to plan them. Again, you do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you choose something from this list, or decide to choose something else. When you are ready, I will start the recording and then give you a minute to choose and five minutes to discuss!}

\emph{I will be give you six minutes in total, one minute to choose and 5 minutes to discuss- remember, try to plan whatever fun thing you talk about during those five minutes. After, I will come back into the video call and give you further instructions. Do you have any questions?}

If no questions, proceed.

Step 5:
- Researcher will start timer for 6 minutes.

Step 6:
- After six minutes, researcher reenters the room and back into camera view, turns up volume on the computer, and stops the recording on Zoom. \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/5.png} You will view this notification in the upper right hand corner that states the recorded file will be converted to mp4 once the meeting ends. \includegraphics{images/zoom_parent_child_interaction/6.png} Move the child/adolescent and parent onto the next task in the session, as the video will not be saved until after the session is complete.

\textbf{Please visit "Post-Online Session Protocols to view instructions on how to save the video recording.}

\emph{Now we are done with the group activity. You can go ahead and take out your token board and gold star stickers, and stick one golden star on the first block, where the movie icon is!}

\emph{Next we will move on to some individual activities, where Mom/Dad will complete some surveys while you {[}Child's name{]} plays a computer game. The computer game is about your child's learning and memory so it is important they dont get help from you! We actually prefer you don't watch the screen so you dont know which pictures they see. If you recall the example from our powerpoint at the beginning of this session, this will be the time that your child will see some pictures on the screen}

\emph{I will now just give {[}Child's name{]} some instructions on the computer game. Let me share my screen so I can show you some examples!}

{[}Researcher to open up the \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/709481066655}{halloween\_training}{]}

\emph{Ok, {[}Child's name{]}- so in this computer game, you are going to go on a trick-or-treating adventure! First, you will be shown instructions that look just like this! The places you will be visiting are houses that either have a toy or a candy. Your job is to do their best to remember what toy or candy is with what house.}

\emph{Here are some examples of what you might see}

\emph{Sometimes you will get a toy while other times you will get a candy, and sometimes you will be visiting a nice house while other times you will be visiting a scary one. Remember that the type of toy or candy will vary and where it is found will differ. You will only be shown the photos for a few seconds, so do your best to memorize these details as quickly and as much as possible!}

\emph{We also want to make sure you are paying attention, so when you see this red triangle, we want you to hit the space bar!}

\emph{You will be reaching a halfway point where you can just click ``continue''}

\emph{There are TWO PARTS to this game- we are only going to be doing PART 1 right now. So, it is super important that when you see the page that says you're finished with this part, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!}

{[}Researcher to stop sharing screen.{]}

\emph{So to get your child setup for the computer game, we will send you a link through the Zoom chat now. Let me know once the link has loaded.}

{[}Researcher to send Gorilla task link through the chat, then wait for them to pull it up.{]}

If necessary - the link can be found \href{https://research.sc/participant/login/20451/publicid}{here}.

{[}Then, confirm they are on the right page{]} \emph{You should be seeing a login screen that asks you to enter your primary participant ID screen.}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/halloween/7.png}

\end{figure}

\emph{While your child is doing the game, you can get started on some parent surveys. So now I will ask you to reach into your Session Package and pull out the booklet titled ``Parent Survey Booklet'' and a pencil to fill these out.}

\emph{We ask that you please fill the surveys out in the order that they are presented so parent proxy first then the parent self surveys. Some of these surveys are about your child and some of these surveys are about you. The game will take around 5-10 minutes and I will notify you when we are finished. You can go ahead and work on the surveys now and your child can start the game.}

\emph{Ok! If you are both ready to start, we will just have Mom/Dad click ``Log in'' on {[}Child's name{]}'s page, and you can both get started!}

{[}Researcher to open \href{https://gorilla.sc}{gorilla} to track participant progress. Click on my projects\textgreater{}MBB\textgreater{}MBB\_wave\_1\_online\textgreater{}participants tab\textgreater{}scroll to their mbb number and click ``view progress''{]}

{[}RESEARCHER TO TAKE NOTES: PARENT BEHAVIOR DURING THE HALLOWEEN TRAINING{]}

{[}If participants do not seem to check-in with researcher after \textasciitilde{}15 minutes, ask if they have any questions{]} \emph{Hi, just wanted to check-in and see if everything was going alright. Do you have any questions?}

{[}Once you confirm on the ``view progress'' node that Halloween training is complete, say{]} \emph{Great job! We have completed the second part of this session- you can go ahead and take out your token board and gold star stickers, and put another star on the second block!}

\hypertarget{w1-o-protocol---height-online}{%
\subsection{W1-O Protocol - Height Online}\label{w1-o-protocol---height-online}}

\emph{Ok, for the next part of this session, we will have you (parent) pause on your surveys so you can help take some measurements from your child (height, weight, and waist). I will ask you to reach into your Magic Box and pull out the ``Session Booklet'', a pencil, and the paper measuring tape.}

{[}Wait for participant to retrieve session booklet, pencil, and paper measuring tape{]}

\emph{This booklet contains all the instructions for our measurements and sample collections during today's session, which you can use for reference if you'd like. I will also walk you through each measurement and collection!}

\emph{We will start with Height! Feel free to grab your paper measuring tape and measure your child's height in inches.}

{[}Researcher to note child's height on the session checklist google form.{]}

\emph{Awesome job! We have completed the next part of this session- you can go ahead and take out your token board and gold star stickers, and put another star on the next block!}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Researcher will be walking the parent through how to measure their child's height via Zoom video call. Ask parent if they have a full length measurement tape. If not, we will proceed with the paper measurement tape.
\item
  Ask parent to place child/adolescent directly against wall/frame
\item
  Advise child/adolescent to stand up straight
\item
  Have parent ensure heels of child/adolescent are up against the wall/frame
\item

\emph{Next, we will do weight! Do you have a weight scale?}

{[}If yes, say{]} \emph{Please go and weigh your child, and return to the screen so we may record the number. You do not have to bring the scale to the camera!} {[}Researcher to note child's weight on the session checklist google form.{]}

{[}If no, say{]} \emph{Can you please record an estimate of your child's weight?} {[}Researcher to note child's weight and check ``approximated'' on the session checklist google form.{]}

{[}Give child instructions on Halloween Test{]} {[}Researcher to open up the \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/709479264913}{halloween\_test}{]}

\emph{Ok {[}Child's name{]}- now we want to see how much of your trick-or-treating adventure you remember. You will see an instructions page like this first!}

\emph{You will first be shown a candy or a toy and will be asked if you saw that candy or toy when you went trick-or-treating. This is where your memory kicks in!}

\emph{Here are some examples of what you might see.}

\emph{The next set of questions show the houses that you visited and asks what candy was found there and where it was located on the screen.}

\emph{Here are examples of what this looks like!}

\emph{We also want you to remember that this is not a test! Just try your best!}

\emph{When you finish, all you have to do is let me know!}

{[}Researcher to stop sharing screen.{]}

\emph{Can you please go back to the ``Gorilla'' website. If you still have the browser up that's great - please refresh the screen to continue. If not, you can go back to the same link as before and enter your MBB ID. Here you will be completing the second part of the computer game.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    1 sheet of aluminum foil
  \item
    1 small ziplock bag with participant ID
  \item
    1 salon grade scissor
  \item
    1 rattail comb
  \item
    Painter-tape
  \item
    2 alligator curl clips
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{explanation}{%
\subsubsection{Explanation}\label{explanation}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Refer to the instructions booklet included in the participant's magic box, found here: \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/739671629603}{hair\_sample\_collection\_instructions}
\item
  Tell the parent that you will go over it verbally with them BEFORE they should start collecting the sample.
\item
  Explain to both the child and parent that they will be collecting 30-50 strands of hair. The amount of hair to be collected is less hair than is lost in normal everyday-brushing from the back of the head. Show them the amount on your own head.
\item
  Inform them how the site for the sampling is hidden by the surrounding hair, therefore not visible after collection.
\item
  Explain how the sample is used to measure a hormone called cortisol that is present in the hair.
\item
  Show on the hair sample picture directions sheet the hair sample taken from the wig to illustrate the amount of hair that will be collected (30-50 strands).
\item
  Offer to show our hair sample collection video if the parent would like a more comprehensive visual.
\item
  After taking the sample, the parent will tape it to the aluminum foil. When doing this, it is VERY important to place the tape at least 3cm below the root end. To show the parent how long 3cm is, you can use the measuring tape provided, or tell them it is 1.5 inches (really closer to 4cm but better longer than shorter).
\item
  If hair kit included painters tape, ensure that at least 3 cm of root is above the painters tape, and that the tape does NOT cover the root. If hair is shorter than 3cm, instruct not to use the tape.
\item
  If hair kit included rubber band, ensure that rubber band is put on hair PRIOR to cutting. The rubber hand then helps secure the bunched hair in the foil after hair sample is taken.
\item
  When they are ready to package the hair sample, ensure that the foil does not fold at the root- this is a very sensitive area in which we are analyzing, and important not to damage!
\item
  When finished, hair sample should be put in the foil, in the ziploc bag, in the white box along with the other samples
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{hair-length}{%
\subsubsection{Hair Length}\label{hair-length}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For short hair (less than or just above 3cm, i.e., too short to tape and still have 3cm usable), follow the Short-Hair Protocol below.
\item
  For longer hair (\textgreater{}3cm), follow the Longer-Hair Protocol below.
\item
  Ideally, hair samples should be at least 3cm long. If the hair is less than 1cm long, the sample cannot be used.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Short-Hair Protocol (1-3cm)- advise parent to:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  See link for instructions with pictures (\url{https://app.box.com/file/755295304996})
\item
  Select a portion of hair from the posterior vertex of the head (in line with ears is a good reference point).
\item
  Use the rattail comb to thin out the hair as much as possible, so that the parent is grasping a horizontal line of hair rather than a chunk.
\item
  Ensure that 30-50 strands are included in the portion being held.
\item
  Hold the loose hair tightly with index finger and thumb, and cut the hair along the part, as close to the scalp and as evenly as possible.
\item
  Place loose hairs in foil and fold it securely. Do NOT tape the hair to the foil.
\item
  Fold the foil without bending the hair, and ensure that the hair does not fall out of the foil.
\item
  Ensure the root-end on the aluminum foil is labeled and place it in the ziplock bag.
\item
  Ensure the ziplock bag is labeled with the participant's ID and Wave.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Longer-Hair Protocol (\textgreater{}3 cm) - advise parent to:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Take the comb and part the hair horizontally between the tips of the ears.
\item
  Take a clip to clip away the hair from the top of the parting.
\item
  Instruct the parent to grasp approx. 30-50 strands of hair under the hair that has been clipped up.
\item
  Use the rattail comb to thin out the hair as much as possible, so that the parent is grasping a horizontal line of hair rather than a chunk. After this step, ensure the parent is still grasping 30-50 strands.
\item
  Instruct the parent to cut the hair sample as close to the scalp as possible.
\item
  Attach the hair to the center of the aluminum foil by taping with painter's tape - leave at least 3 cm of hair from the root end; not cover the root end.
\item
  If parent does not know how much 3cm is, you can: say that they can measure it with the cm side of the measuring tape; if they know inches say it is about 1.5 inches (really closer to 4cm but better too long than too short); or offer to demonstrate based on the length of your own finger.
\item
  Place the hair inside the aluminum foil in the orientation indicated by the ``root'' written on the foil.
\item
  Fold the foil without bending the hair, and ensure that the hair does not fall out of the foil.
\item
  Place the folded foil in the ziplock bag.
\item
  Put the ziploc bag back in the magic box.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Now we are all done with the hair sample! You can go ahead and put another star on your token board!}

  Open the mailer to ensure that it contains both the stool sample (in biohazard bag) and the Bristol Stool Scale.
\item
  Check for quality of the stool sample by shaking it up and down vigorously (keep the sample in the biohazard bag), then check for its consistency and color - It should be a dark-brown liquid.
\item
  If stool sample does not meet requirement (e.g.~sample is in solid form or amount collected is too little), contact the family to see if they would be willing to send another sample with compensation.
\item
  Contact family if the Bristol Stool Scale is missing in the mailer.

\subsubsection{Data Audit}\label{data-audit}}

\textbf{Before reaching out to participants}

It is important to check that information marked as missing on the participant's Trello card is \emph{actually} missing before reaching out to participant to request it.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Check for the missing information in the participant's folder on Box
\item
  If a REDCap survey is missing check if it was maybe just not input on REDCap but is there in participant folder
\item
  Look through email threads with participant for info on why a file might be missing or if they sent it to us in the past
\item
  If it is info the researcher collected during the session ( height, weight, waist) check if researcher has that info
\end{itemize}

IF the information is actually missing then you can go ahead and reach out to the participant

\begin{itemize}
\item
  You will be sending them editable copies of the files they are missing. It is advised you create some way to track each file ( ex. you can name file as date of session and then delete that name later on)
\item
  There is an email template available in the BAB email under templates titled ``MBB\_O - Data Audits Mind Brain Body Study''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Timeline for Data Audits:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Call participant and request missing information from them (surveys, contact list, etc). After calling ( and leaving a voicemail if they don'tt answer) send them an email requesting they fill out missing info and upload it to our \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/f/3c52df2afb1a446ab363b793f8af22c1}{Box folder}
\item
  \emph{One week later} call them again and send another email. Leave a voicemail if they don't answer.
\item
  \emph{One week later} call them again and send a third email. Leave a voicemail if they don't answer. At this point if you have not heard from them \emph{at all} you can end the audit for that person.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    if you \emph{have} heard from participant but haven't gotten the missing info then extend the audit a week or two at your discrection if you think they will complete the missing info.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{documenting-the-audits}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Documenting the audits}}{Documenting the audits}}\label{documenting-the-audits}}

\textbf{The folder for Box uploads is in BABLAB/Studies/Mind\_Brain\_Body/Data/Wave\_1\_online/Uploads} Check it to see if participant's have uploaded the missing info

\textbf{After each contact}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Make sure you write in the description the date you reached out to participant and any notes from the contact
\item
  If the participant did not seem willing to provide the missing info make a note
\item
  If participant emailed add date of contact into description too

\subsection{W1-O Protocol - Data Entry Check Board Audits}\label{w1-o-protocol---data-entry-check-board-audits}}

RA's will be conducting Data Entry Checks to ensure that all data collected from MBB participants is accurately entered in REDcap. To audit the data entry checks, read over all notes in the Data Entry CHECK tab in the MBB\_participant\_log to identify errors that need to be fixed (ie. data entered incorrectly, discrepancy between paper copy and REDcap form).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Open the MBB\_participant\_log and go to the Data Entry CHECK tab for whichever wave you are checking.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
**GREEN** items are attributed to completed/accurate sections, OR if an RA had found a discrepancy between the REDcap and paper copy and was able to fix it themselves.

**YELLOW** items are attributed to incomplete sections where:
  - participant did not complete (paper is blank)
  - participant was not given this survey (not given on paper)

  These items were most likely not completed by the participant, so there will be no data to verify.

**RED** items are attributed to sections where:
  - data is missing on REDCap from paper copy, but no place to put it on REDCap
  - data is added on REDCap but not on paper copy
  - data entry is missing but illegible
  - any other less common discrepancies that need to be double checked
  
  **These items have been flagged by an RA and require auditing.**
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Open REDcap and go to corresponding MBB participant that requires auditing.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For any flagged items, read notes on Participant Log and the participant's REDCap to get an idea of the issue. If necessary, locate the participant's paper copy in their ``Data'' folder to verify the discrepancy. (Can be found in BABLAB \textgreater{} Studies \textgreater{} Mind\_Brain\_Body \textgreater{} Data \textgreater{} (wave) \textgreater{} Wave\_data)
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{IF} the issue is fixable, edit the item on REDcap to match the paper copy, and note the item as Complete on the MBB\_participant\_log.

\textbf{IF} there is a discrepancy between the paper copy and REDcap, check an updated version of the paper copy to verify whether this discrepancy has been fixed since the participant completed the study. The paper copies can be found at BABLAB \textgreater{} Studies \textgreater{} Mind\_Brain\_Body \textgreater{} Documents \textgreater{} Questionnaires \textgreater{} Wave\_X (specific to which wave you are checking)

If the paper copy has not been updated, make a note and report to lab manager. If the paper copy has been updated, then this will be a case where we are missing data from the participant because they did not receive some of the questions that are now on REDCap.
- Open the Trello Data Audit Board, and locate the MBB participant's card.
- Under \textbf{Description}, note the date of the data entry audit check, and provide a note explaining the missing items. (See below for example)
- Under \textbf{Incomplete}, note specific questions that participant did not receive on their paper copy. Lab Manager will then assess the importance of these questions, and whether they need to be retrieved during data audits, or the next wave of data collection.
- Once Trello is updated, \textbf{unflag items on MBB Participant Log, and mark as Complete.}

\textbf{IF} the issue is not fixable -- write detailed notes of where the discrepancy needs to be fixed, and report it to the Lab Manager. Lab Manager should assess the amount of items missing, the importance of the items to the scale and to the overall study, and the process in which audits have been conducted to see if it would be convenient to re-request such information. After assessing such details, the Lab Manager should decide how to proceed with the issue on a base-by-base situation.

\textbf{IF} there is an instance where the paper copy is illegible, or multiple options have been selected, verify with Lab Manager on how it should be entered onto REDcap. Lab Manager should refer to the above details to assess what the importance of the item is. Lab Manager should then decide whether or not to recontact the participant for explanations on illegible handwriting.

\textbf{Examples:}

\textbf{Participant:} MBB033

\textbf{Item:} Covid\_Objective\_Parentproxy

\textbf{Issue:} ``Did your child's school close due to outbreak'' answer not inputted into Redcap, which didn't activate the rest of questions to be entered. Participant answered ``Yes'' and ``homeschooled'' and answered rest of questions, however the follow-up questions were not inputted into redcap, because only one option can be selected for ``Did your child's school close due to outbreak''

\textbf{Resolve:} In this situation, we may assume that the participant should have circled ``yes'' in order to activate the branch logic-ed items on REDCap that they did fill out on paper, which must have applied to them.

\textbf{Participant:} MBB033

\textbf{Item:} Demographics\_parentproxy

\textbf{Issue:} Participant selected ``bachelors degree'' AND ``other'' and wrote Theatre degree

\textbf{Resolve:} Because we are looking how many years they studied (professional; bachelors, etc.) it doesn't matter which type of degree they specify if so.

\textbf{Participant:} MBB035

\textbf{Item:} Cbcl\_parentproxy

\textbf{Issue:} Participant selected ``not true'' AND ``sometimes true'' however, it looks like a mistake because they often erased and changed their answers and may have forgotten to erase one of the checkmarks.

\textbf{Resolve:} For not true and sometimes true, probably would make it sometimes true (not zero)
For sometimes true and true, choose the middle - So select sometimes true in this case. The one that would impact composite the least.

\subsection{W2 Checklist - Initial Online}\label{w2-checklist---initial-online}}

\textbf{Calling participants from REDCap}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Participants can be considered ``recontact in a month'' if they meet all of the following criteria:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Researcher has tried to contact individual at different times of day.
  \item
    Researcher has used at least 3 different approaches (e.g.~email, phone, text message), UNLESS only 2 forms of contact have been given, in which case participant should fully meet all other criteria.
  \item
    Researcher has been reaching out for two weeks ( contact at least every three days in some format)\\
  \item
    Situation is NOT considered ``phone tag'' (a participant calls and lab member returns call but keeps missing one another- this shows participant may still be interested, therefore number of contact and lack of response may not be due to lack of interest. Participants in ``phone tag'' situation should stay on contact list).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Important Reminders}

\textbf{Calendar}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Put the W2 for wave two ( e.g.~S1 W2 ) on session events
\item
  For reminder emails put Status: Incomplete in description
\item
  For Session 1 Reminder 1 call event put ``Only if no email response'' in the description and then status: Incomplete
\item
  Whenever you complete a reminder event mark it as complete and update the MBB participant log
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Emails to participants}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All emails to a participant should be in the same thread\\
\item
  \textbf{Remember that email templates need to be edited}(e.g.~there are no written responses in wave 2 so that chunk should be deleted, there is no ASA in wave 1 so that should be deleted in wave 1, etc.)
\item
  The thread we initially contacted them at should be the one we send the session confirmation to\\
\item
  The easiest way to not forget steps is to do all ``session has just been scheduled'' tasks based on the MBB log\\
\item
  Make sure you are sending the correct reminder email - S1 R2 is the one with the researcher card
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Confirming sessions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do not put as ``confirmed session'' on MBB log unless we got verbal confirmation / email confirmation
\item
  If called and no answer leave a note on the calendar event saying was not able to verbally confirm \& also put into SRA chat
\end{itemize}

\textbf{REDCap}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When you schedule a new MBB participant change their SMBB ``Wave 2 status'' to enrolled\\
\item
  Make a new screening entry every time you schedule a participant
\item
  \textbf{For participant instrument - Age should be the age of participant at the time of \emph{Session 1} }
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Scheduling and Confirmation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Schedule session 1 two weeks in advance from ``package mailing day'' (see package preparation in pre-session checklist)
\item
  Schedule session 2 \textasciitilde{}one week after session 1
\item
  Ask lab manager to make Zoom link with scheduled session times and save to google calendar
\item
  Send session 1 confirmation email (in templates)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Attach \href{https://app.box.com/file/776654994352}{Infographic}, \href{https://app.box.com/file/774936561660}{Next Steps}, \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/680632734387}{Computer Zoom Download Instructions}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Enrollment}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create participant Box folder using MBB\_template\\
\item
  Enroll participant in Wave 2 on REDCap

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Go to ``Add / Edit Records'' of MBB
  \item
    Make sure the tab is ``Arm 3: wave 2''
  \item
    Type in their MBB
  \item
    Be careful because any premature clicking makes a new ID
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Fill participant instrument on REDCap

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Age should be the age of participant at the time of \emph{Session 1} }
  \item
    In notes section add the date and time of session, recollected surveys needed \& any relevant info from scheduling call\\
  \item
    \textbf{Essential to fill out the ``Is this wave 2'' question}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check for note on whether or not parent wanted questionnaires to be given online or on paper, adjust script accordingly
  \item
    the participant info should also contain info about whether there are recollected surveys to administer (both that parent received in parent survey packet or child surveys we'll administer in session)
  \item
    If there is a child survey that needs to be recollected get the survey code so that it can be easily accessed during session
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Check to see if they did blood sample last year, it's in the participant log on the Wave 1 - Data Entry sheet.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If they didn't last year it might be really helpful to explain arm poke in detail early on, during initial presentation, before they consent.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Open Slack and keep open for entirety of session for communication with the research team/Lab Manager
\item
  Claim host so you have the ability to record

\item
  We are not rescreening them, the call will be just for letting them know we're now in wave 2 and scheduling their session
\item
  All attempts at contacting participant including reaching out to the individuals on their contact lists should be documented as a screening on REDCap. Make sure to always make a note of voicemail left, email sent etc.
\item
  Remember to change the recontect date after each contact attempt and to lock each screening so there is unaltered record of who reached out and when.
\item
  \textbf{Parents will verbally opt in to text reminders at the time of screen call which will be their ``consent'' to be texted.}

    It is a timing issue - Should we call you back in a couple months?

{[}ONCE ZOOM IS CONNECTED{]}

\emph{Hi! Thank you so much for joining us today! We are so looking forward to today's session with you. }

\emph{Our session today should take around 2 hours long. In addition to what we do here today, there will be a follow up zoom appointment with us one week from now. At that appointment, we will reconnect on a second Zoom call in which your child will log on for 15 minutes and complete a computer game.}

\emph{I'll be sending a message to the chat box just to make sure everything is working. You may already know this, but you can also display your camera so that it is in gallery view or speaker view in the top right corner. I think it might be best for you to do speaker view so it will feel more like we are in the room together!}

\emph{If for any reason, we lose each other over Zoom, the connection seems to be bad, or one of us freezes, lets leave the session and try to reconnect on the same link again. If I am frozen- feel free to leave and come back. If you leave and I don't see you come back, I will try to give you a phone call!}

\emph{How does that sound? Do you have any questions?}

{[}If no, say{]} \emph{Great! Let's switch gears and talk a little bit about what we are going to do today. Let me just pull up a little presentation we have got!}

\hypertarget{w2-protocol---consent-assent-online}{%
\subsection{W2 Protocol - Consent \& Assent Online}\label{w2-protocol---consent-assent-online}}

\emph{Before we begin, I just wanted to let you know that in this study, we ask a lot of questions about family life and tough things that might have happened to kids. We are going to ask these questions to you and we ask a couple to your children as well, we just want to let you know that it is in our protocol to make sure everyone is safe, so if you or your child reveals to us that you're at current risk of harm or if you're at risk of harming someone else, then we will follow up with you and make sure everything is okay. If it is not, then we will take some steps to make sure that we keep everyone safe.}

\emph{First thing we are going to do is go over what is on the consent and assent forms. (These are the attached documents we sent you in the emails leading up to this session.) We will walk through, in a little bit more detail, all of the things we will be doing during today's session.}

\emph{During today's online session we are going to be doing some interactive things. First, we are going to have you and your parent sit and talk about some not so fun things and some fun things while on ZOOM. This conversation will be recorded but we will not be watching or listening in}

\emph{Next, we are going to have you play a game on the computer. In this game, you will be looking at pictures. Some of the pictures will be a bit scary, some sad, others a bit boring. While you are playing this game, your parent will stay with you in the room but will be working on some surveys to fill out.}

\emph{After the game is over, your parent {[}NAME{]} will help measure your height, weight, and waist circumference.}

\emph{You will also be answering some surveys (for children) with the researcher OR (for teens) on your own.}

\emph{Lastly for today, your parent will help take two biological samples during this session.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  One is the hair sample which helps measure hormones that everyone has in their hair
\item
  Two is the split sample which helps tell us learn a little bit more about your microbiome

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Do you know what a microbiome is?
  \item
    A microbiome is all the little bacteria that live inside your mouth. Everyone has these, they are healthy! We just want to know what kind and how many of each there are.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\emph{For helping us out in today's session, you will be getting \$30 for the work you put in! After this online session is over, we'll ask you to do four more things in the second session:}

\emph{1. One is the Child poop sample -- this helps us learn a bit more about your microbiome}

\emph{- There are also little bacteria that live in your tummy! Everyone has these and we want to know more about them.}

\emph{2. Two is filling out the stool scale -- this is a short scale that gives a description of your sample}

\emph{3. Three is the computer memory game -- this is when you will log back on with us via ZOOM in a week's time to see what you remember from today's session}

\emph{4. Four is the blood sample -- this helps us look at immune markers which are very important for interpreting microbiome system because those systems talk to each other}

\emph{Great! Do you have any questions for us about any of the samples}

\emph{Later in the year when things are safer, we would like you to invite you to come in for an optional brain scan using the MRI machine. You don't have to decide whether you want to do that now, but we just wanted to mention it here.}

\emph{You will receive \$20 for doing the poop sample and \$15 more for doing the blood sample!}

\emph{We will send the full payment of \$65 (\$30 for today's session, \$20 for the poop sample, and \$15 for the blood sample) as soon as we receive the samples back through the mail.}

\emph{Here are some things to keep in mind:}

\emph{You are a volunteer in this study, which means you do not have to do anything, or say anything, that makes you uncomfortable. We would like you to try everything you can, and to do your best, but if there are things you absolutely do not want to do, just tells us, that is o.k.}

\emph{Another thing we want to remind you is that nothing you do today is a TEST!! We want you to try your best, but there is no ``right'' or ``wrong'' answers in anything you do today. We just want to learn about you!}

\emph{We will keep your participation confidential. You are given an ID number in order to keep your data confidential and separated from your name. Therefore, any identifying information (like your name, email, address, etc.) will be kept private and not paired with your data. We will also use a secondary ID number to save the videos with (since your faces are in it), which will help separate this from your name and the other data we collect form you. Only members of our research team will have access to your name and ID numbers.}

\emph{I will rename your ``ZOOM Name'' right now with your Secondary ID number, to prepare for the recordings we will take in our session today}

{[}Researcher will rename the participant's name to ``P'' for participant. {]}

\emph{Ok- I will now send you a link through the Zoom chat, which will open up a survey that allows you to virtually indicate your consent to participate in the study. Please feel free to take your time reading through the consent and assent forms now if you'd like. As I mentioned earlier, these are the documents we had previously sent you in the emails leading up to today's session.}

{[}Bottom of consent form has the information about the arm poke, make sure to mention that and note whether they consent{]}

{[}Then once they are done reading through{]}

\emph{All set and any questions?}

{[}IF NO,{]} \emph{Please click to indicate yours and your child's consent/assent and verbally let us know each of the items you have consented/not consented for, so we can adjust the session in case there is something you/your child may not feel up for today!}

\emph{Once you are all set with that, we'd like you for to grab the magic box we sent you in the mail. This contains everything you will need for today's session and what you will do as apart of Session 2 as well.}

\emph{If you haven't already done so, please open the magic box up. The magic box should contain a sheet of paper at the top which details all of the contents, but we will let you know when you need to take each item out of the box. Please set aside the magic box for now but keep the materials near you as we may need to access materials from the magic box throughout today's session!}

\emph{What you can pull out now and use throughout the session is the Reward Board and Gold Star Stickers. Use this reward board to track all the steps you accomplish today! Each space is like each task for the session. Once you complete the task you can put a gold star on the space!}

\subsection{W2 Protocol - Parent Child Observation Online}\label{w2-protocol---parent-child-observation-online}}

The parent and child will be seated together in view on the Zoom camera. During that time they will be filmed while solving a conflict, and then again while discussing a pleasant event. The conflict event will always go first, followed by the pleasant event. We did this to ensure that the parents were not thinking of the negative interaction upon answering the questionnaires about their child, which they did immediately after the observation interaction.

{[}RESEARCHER SHOULD ASSESS VOLUME. If participant volume is too low, recording will not pick it up. Ensure that volume is at an appropriate frequency before proceeding to PC interaction recordings.{]}

{[}RESEARCHER SHOULD CHANGE TO SPEAKER VIEW. Participants should be in speaker view so recording will enlarge the parent and child for behavior analysis.{]}

Step 1:

The researcher will ask the parent to find the \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/630327764749}{Pleasant/Unpleasant Events Checklist} piece of paper from their session package.

\emph{Researcher: So the first thing we will have you pull out of the magic box is the paper packet titled ``Online Session Booklet.'' You can flip to the page that says ``Issues Checklist.''}

Researcher will wait for the participant to find the Online Session Booklet and flip to the correct page.

\emph{Researcher: Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss something that's hard and try to resolve it. On this piece of paper (Issues Checklist) is a list of things that parents and children sometimes have disagreements about. We will give you a moment to read the list and think about some that you would like to discuss together. Then after about one minute, you will start discussing the things you have selected and try to resolve them. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from this list, or decide to choose something else. Please choose something you can try to resolve (not an emotionally charged topic that would be difficult to discuss together right now). And we want you to remember- this is not a test and there are no right or wrong things to say!}

\emph{I am going to turn off my camera and mute myself to be out of the recording, and I will also turn my volume down low and will not be listening in closely. I will come back in and let you know when the six minutes are all done!}

\emph{When you are ready, I will begin the recording and give you a total of 6 minutes- one minute or so to choose, then five minutes to discuss! Are you ready?}

Step 2:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Researcher will ensure Zoom security settings are set up for the video.
\item
  Parent and child will be situated side-by-side in view on the Zoom camera.
\end{itemize}

-Researcher will press record on the Zoom application. Wait to hear the audio Zoom confirmation \emph{``this meeting is now being recorded''} and view recording in progress at top left of screen to ensure recording is live.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Researcher set timer for 6 minutes
\end{itemize}

Step 3:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Researcher will mute themselves on Zoom and turn off their camera, and step out of the room.
\item
  Researcher will start timer for 6 minutes. At the end of 6 minutes, reenter camera view and unmute themselves.
\end{itemize}

{[}After 6 minutes have passed, say{]} \emph{Thank you for taking the time to discuss something difficult. Next we are going to take some film of you talking about something nice. You can flip to the page that says ``Pleasant Events Checklist.'' On your ``Pleasant Events Checklist'' is a list of fun things that parents and children sometimes do together. I will give you a moment to read the list and pick something that you would like to plan to do together. Then after about one minute, you will start discussing the things you have selected and try to plan them. Again, you do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you choose something from this list, or decide to choose something else. When you are ready, I will start the recording and then give you a minute to choose and five minutes to discuss!}

\emph{I will be give you six minutes in total, one minute to choose and 5 minutes to discuss- remember, try to plan whatever fun thing you talk about during those five minutes. After, I will come back into the video call and give you further instructions. Do you have any questions?}

If no questions, proceed.

Step 5:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Researcher will start timer for 6 minutes.
\end{itemize}

Step 6:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  After six minutes, researcher reenters the room and back into camera view, turns up volume on the computer, and stops the recording on Zoom. You will view this notification in the upper right hand corner that states the recorded file will be converted to mp4 once the meeting ends. Move the child/adolescent and parent onto the next task in the session, as the video will not be saved until after the session is complete.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Now we are done with the group activity. You can go ahead and take out your token board and gold star stickers, and stick one golden star on the first block, where the movie icon is!}

\emph{Next we will move on to some individual activities, where Mom/Dad will complete some surveys while you {[}Child's name{]} plays a computer game. The computer game is about your child's learning and memory so it is important they don't get help from you! We actually prefer you don't watch the screen so you don't know which pictures they see. If you recall the example from our powerpoint at the beginning of this session, this will be the time that your child will see some pictures on the screen}

\textbf{{[}If the parent decided to fill out questionnaires on paper, say{]}}
\emph{While your child is doing the game, you can get started on some parent surveys. So now I will ask you to reach into your Session Package and pull out the booklets titled ``Parent Proxy Surveys'' and ``Parent Self Surveys'' and a pencil to fill these out.}
\emph{We ask that you please fill the parent proxy surveys first and then parent self surveys. Some of these surveys are about your child and some of these surveys are about you. The game will take around 5-10 minutes and I will notify you when we are finished. You can go ahead and work on the surveys now while your child plays the game.}

\textbf{{[}If the parent decided to fill out questionnaires online, say{]}}
\emph{While your child is doing the game, you can get started on some parent surveys. So now I will ask you to grab your secondary device and log into the ``links email'' I sent just before the start of our session. In that email, you will find two links and two codes- one for parent proxy surveys and another for parent self surveys.}
\emph{We ask that you please fill the parent proxy surveys first and then parent self surveys. Some of these surveys are about your child and some of these surveys are about you. In addition to these two sets, there is a short packet of paper surveys to complete- these are recollected surveys that you may not have finished from wave 1 of our study.}
\emph{The game will take around 5-10 minutes and I will notify you when we are finished. You can go ahead and work on the surveys now while your child plays the game.}

\emph{I will now just give {[}Child's name{]} some instructions on the computer game. Let me share my screen so I can show you some examples!}

Researcher to open up the \href{https://app.box.com/file/784726680410}{halloween\_training}{]}

\emph{Ok, {[}Child's name{]}- so in this computer game, you are going to go on a trick-or-treating adventure! First, you will be shown instructions that look just like this! The places you will be visiting are scenes that either have a toy or food. Your job is to do their best to remember what toy or food is with what scene.}

\emph{Here is an examples of what you might see}

\emph{In this picture, you are at a park and you got pancakes!}

\emph{Here is another example.}

\emph{In this picture, you are at a dark forest and you got a pogo stick!}

\emph{Sometimes you will get food while other times you will get a toy, and sometimes you will be visiting a nice place while other times you will be visiting a scary one. Remember that the type of food or toy will vary and where it is found will differ. You will only be shown the photos for a few seconds, so do your best to memorize what food or toy goes with each place as quickly and as much as possible!}

\emph{We also want to make sure you are paying attention, so when you see this red triangle, we want you to hit the space bar (or click the square)!}

\emph{You will be reaching a halfway point where you can just click ``continue''}

\emph{There are TWO PARTS to this game- we are only going to be doing PART 1 right now. So, it is super important that when you see the page that says you're finished with this part, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!}

{[}Researcher to stop sharing screen.{]}

\emph{So to get setup for the computer game, we will send you a link through the Zoom chat now. Let me know once the link has loaded.}

{[}Researcher to send Gorilla task link through the chat, then wait for them to pull it up.{]}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Advise parent to hold tape measure at the child/adolescent's belly button and bring it around their waist, over their t-shirt
\item
  Make sure measuring tape is horizontal around the waist and even in the front and back
\item
  Keep the tape snug around the waist, but not compressing the skin
\item
  Have participant breathe in
\item
  Measure the participant's waist just after they breathe out

{[}Give child instructions on Halloween Test{]} {[}Researcher to open up the \href{https://app.box.com/file/784728666967}{halloween\_test}{]}

\emph{Ok {[}Child's name{]}- now we want to see how much of your trick-or-treating adventure you remember. You will see an instructions page like this first!}

\emph{In part A you will be shown food or a toy and will be asked if you saw that food or toy when you went trick-or-treating. This is where your memory kicks in!}

\emph{Here are some examples of what you might see.}

\emph{In this case you are shown a pancake and asked did you see this while you were trick-or-treating}

\emph{If you answer yes or no you will then be asked how sure are you that you saw that food or toy.}

\emph{Part B shows the scenes that you visited and asks what food or toy was found there and where it was located on the screen.}

\emph{Here are examples of what this looks like!}

\emph{You will be shown a picture like this and asked which of the three choices you saw at that place.}

\emph{Then you will be asked where on the picture you saw the food or toy.}

\emph{If you are not sure you remember where the toy or food was,that is completely okay! We just ask that you make your best guess!}

\emph{Again, when you see the red triangle make sure you hit the space bar or click the square.}

\emph{When you finish, all you have to do is let me know!}

{[}Researcher to stop sharing screen.{]}

\emph{Can you please go back to the ``Gorilla'' website. If you still have the browser up that's great - please refresh the screen to continue. If not, you can go back to the same link as before and enter your MBB ID. Here you will be completing the second part of the computer game.}

{[}Wait for child to log back on with primary participant ID{]}

\hypertarget{set-up-hair-sample-station}{%
\subsubsection{Set Up Hair Sample Station}\label{set-up-hair-sample-station}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ask parent to gather the following materials for their ``hair-sample station'':

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    1 sheet of aluminum foil (provided)
  \item
    1 small ziplock bag with participant ID (provided)
  \item
    Painter-tape (provided)
  \item
    1 scissor (salon grade if they have)
  \item
    1 rat-tail comb to thin out hair (provided)
  \item
    2 alligator clips (provided)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Researcher set up the following materials (to help explain hair sample collection):

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    1 sheet of aluminum foil
  \item
    1 small ziplock bag with participant ID
  \item
    1 salon grade scissor
  \item
    1 rattail comb
  \item
    Painter-tape
  \item
    2 alligator curl clips
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{explanation}{%
\subsubsection{Explanation}\label{explanation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Refer to the instructions booklet included in the participant's magic box, found here: \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/file/739671629603}{hair\_sample\_collection\_instructions}
\item
  Tell the parent that you will go over it verbally with them BEFORE they should start collecting the sample.
\item
  Explain to both the child and parent that they will be collecting 30-50 strands of hair. The amount of hair to be collected is less hair than is lost in normal everyday-brushing from the back of the head. Show them the amount on your own head.
\item
  Inform them how the site for the sampling is hidden by the surrounding hair, therefore not visible after collection.
\item
  Explain how the sample is used to measure a hormone called cortisol that is present in the hair.
\item
  Show on the hair sample picture directions sheet the hair sample taken from the wig to illustrate the amount of hair that will be collected (30-50 strands).
\item
  Offer to show our hair sample collection video if the parent would like a more comprehensive visual.
\item
  After taking the sample, the parent will tape it to the aluminum foil. When doing this, it is VERY important to place the tape at least 3cm below the root end. To show the parent how long 3cm is, you can use the measuring tape provided, or tell them it is 1.5 inches (really closer to 4cm but better longer than shorter).
\item
  If hair kit included painters tape, ensure that at least 3 cm of root is above the painters tape, and that the tape does NOT cover the root. If hair is shorter than 3cm, instruct not to use the tape.
\item
  If hair kit included rubber band, ensure that rubber band is put on hair PRIOR to cutting. The rubber hand then helps secure the bunched hair in the foil after hair sample is taken.
\item
  When they are ready to package the hair sample, ensure that the foil does not fold at the root- this is a very sensitive area in which we are analyzing, and important not to damage!
\item
  When finished, hair sample should be put in the foil, in the ziploc bag, in the white box along with the other samples
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{hair-length}{%
\subsubsection{Hair Length}\label{hair-length}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For short hair (less than or just above 3cm, i.e., too short to tape and still have 3cm usable), follow the Short-Hair Protocol below.
\item
  For longer hair (\textgreater{}3cm), follow the Longer-Hair Protocol below.
\item
  Ideally, hair samples should be at least 3cm long. If the hair is less than 1cm long, the sample cannot be used.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Short-Hair Protocol (1-3cm)- advise parent to:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Select a portion of hair from the posterior vertex of the head (in line with ears is a good reference point).
\item
  Use the rattail comb to thin out the hair as much as possible, so that the parent is grasping a horizontal line of hair rather than a chunk.
\item
  Ensure that 30-50 strands are included in the portion being held.
\item
  Hold the loose hair tightly with index finger and thumb, and cut the hair along the part, as close to the scalp and as evenly as possible.
\item
  Place loose hairs in foil and fold it securely. Do NOT tape the hair to the foil.
\item
  Fold the foil without bending the hair, and ensure that the hair does not fall out of the foil.
\item
  Ensure the root-end on the aluminum foil is labeled and place it in the ziplock bag.
\item
  Ensure the ziplock bag is labeled with the participant's ID and Wave.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Longer-Hair Protocol (\textgreater{}3 cm) - advise parent to:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Take the comb and part the hair horizontally between the tips of the ears.
\item
  Take a clip to clip away the hair from the top of the parting.
\item
  Instruct the parent to grasp approx. 30-50 strands of hair under the hair that has been clipped up.
\item
  Use the rattail comb to thin out the hair as much as possible, so that the parent is grasping a horizontal line of hair rather than a chunk. After this step, ensure the parent is still grasping 30-50 strands.
\item
  Instruct the parent to cut the hair sample as close to the scalp as possible.
\item
  Attach the hair to the center of the aluminum foil by taping with painter's tape - leave at least 3 cm of hair from the root end; not cover the root end.
\item
  If parent does not know how much 3cm is, you can: say that they can measure it with the cm side of the measuring tape; if they know inches say it is about 1.5 inches (really closer to 4cm but better too long than too short); or offer to demonstrate based on the length of your own finger.
\item
  Place the hair inside the aluminum foil in the orientation indicated by the ``root'' written on the foil.
\item
  Fold the foil without bending the hair, and ensure that the hair does not fall out of the foil.
\item
  Place the folded foil in the ziplock bag.
\item
  Put the ziploc bag back in the magic box.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Now we are all done with the hair sample! You can go ahead and put another star on your token board!}

Step 2:

When the video conversion is complete, the video files will be saved in a folder titled ``Zoom'' on your computer, wherever your current automatic working directory is saved.

To check where your automatic working directory is saved, login to Zoom and click on ``Recordings'' on the left menu column. Then switch to ``Local Recordings'' and view the Location for correct Meeting Recording you have just captured.

Step 3:

There will be three files in the folder- find the mp4 file and click open to ensure you have captured and converted the file successfully.

Step 4:

Check the External drive for the participant's secondary ID number, and rename all 3 files with their secondary ID (MBB\_2\_XXX). Then upload to Box in Save files to box in Box/BABLAB/Studies/Mind\_Brain\_Body/Data/Wave\_X/Wave\_X\_parent\_child\_interactions/MBB\_2\_999

  Prepare your station and ensure that you have the following:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Incubator with thermometer
  \item
    Vortex machine
  \item
    Eppendorf pipette (1000uL)
  \item
    Pipette tips (wide bore, sterile, universal fit)
  \item
    2.0mL cryogenic vials (with O rings, sterile)
  \item
    Saliva samples in room temperature plastic box\\
  \item
    Test tube rack
  \item
    Transport box with divider
  \item
    Industrial Sharpie for labeling
  \item
    Notebook for sample logs with pen
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Steps for incubation:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Retrieve the box of saliva samples at room temperature in BAB Lab Cabinet 1 and carry them to HPL.
\item
  Plug in and turn on the incubator, turn the dial to level 10 and ensure the red ``heating light'' is on.
\item
  Continuously check the incubator to see what if temperature has reached 50-55C.
\item
  While waiting for the incubator to hit 50 C, clean workspace using ethynol and paper towels (dispose these in the regular trash bin)
\item
  Open the saliva sample box in HPL and note down the list of samples to be processed today, and ensure the lid on each of these samples is shut very tight. If the lid is slightly opened, the sample may risk evaporation during incubation.
\item
  Ensure you are wearing gloves when grabbing the 2.0mL cryovials. Label two cryovials per sample for those that will be processed today (use the Industrial Sharpie). Place them in the transport box for temporary storage.
\item
  When the incubator has reached 50C, turn down the heat to level 6. The incubator temperature will still rise slowly, but when the door is opened for samples to be put in, the temperature can drop anywhere between 5-10C, depending upon how long the door is opened. To account for this temperature loss, heat the incubator to about 55C.
\item
  When the temperature reaches 55C, open the incubator door and place all saliva tubes standing upright on the incubator tray.
\item
  \textbf{IMPORTANT NOTE:} the incubator is extremely sensitive to movement - the saliva samples are likely to fall over with any large tap and/or placement of saliva samples on the tray inside. Be very careful placing samples onto the tray, closing the incubator door, and opening the incubator door once the incubation has completed.
\item
  Close the incubator door \emph{very} carefully and turn the knob as needed to regulated the temperature towards 50C. If the heat has dropped significantly, turn to level 10. If the heat has dropped slightly, move towards 6-8. If the heat is still too high, drop to level 2-4. If the heat is about right, keep the knob at level 5.
\item
  Note down the current time and set an alarm for 2 hours to continue processing. Continue to check the incubator regularly to ensure temperature level is still at 50C and heat level does not need adjusting.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Steps for processing:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Once the tubes have incubated for 2 hours, retrieve the cryovials, test tube rack, pipettes, pipette tips, and sample log notebook with pen.
\item
  \textbf{Very carefully}, open the incubator door and remove five samples to place in the test tube rack. Close the incubator door. (NOTE: the samples are not very hot, so no additional safety protection is needed beyond gloves. If extremely sensitive to heat touch, use a paper towel to grab the samples out of the incubator.)
\item
  Carry the five samples in the test tube rack to the vortex machine. Place one sample on the vortex machine and press down, holding for 20 seconds while the sample is shaken.
\item
  After each sample is vortexed, turn the sample upside down and back up to see if any is still too viscous. If so, vortex for an additional 20 seconds.
\item
  Carry the samples back to the Pipettes in the BAB area of HPL. Select the 1000uL pipette and spin the dial until the numbers on the back of the pipette read 1000. Open the box of pipette tips.
\item
  \textbf{PIPETTING SAMPLE:} Locate the labeled cryovials for the sample you will process. Open the sample tube and place back down into the test tube holder. Open the cryovial and hold tube with one hand. Grab the pipette, push down into a new pipette tip, place into sample, press down until first stop, release to suck in first 1000uL. Release the sample into the cryovial, pressing down until second stop. Place pipette down on its side. Close the cryovial and place back into transfer box. Open the second cryovial, pipette what is left from the saliva sample into the second cryovial before placing into the transfer box. When there is no saliva left in the sample tube, close it and dispose in the biohazard bin. Release the pipette tip by pressing on the button located on the back of the pipette into the biohazard bin. Write down the sample quality and location in the sample log notebook.
\item
  Wipe down the table with ethynol before replacing gloves, disposing in biohazard bin.
\item
  Return to the incubator for the next five samples, repeating the \textbf{PIPETTING SAMPLE} step above for the rest of the samples.
\item
  Once the samples have been processed, transfer the samples to the -20 freezer in the saliva box.
\item
  Turn the knob on the incubator back to zero, and turn the incubator off. If researcher would like to return the incubtaor to room temperature quick, the incubator door may be opened to release heat faster.
\item
  Take a picture of the sample log notebook and transfer notes to the sample log on Box

-Take the Hazards key with you from the lock box in the Lab. Make sure there are two keys attached- a large gold key and a small gold key.
-Head to HPL. Once inside, put on PPE.
-Find the large gray cart in the back room, and wheel into the main HPL lab space. This will assist you in carrying the Hazards bin to the waste area. Put the entire Hazards bin (with the hazards bag full of materials) onto the gray cart.\\
-Ensure you either leave the HPL keys in the lockbox on the door or take them with you.
-Wheel the cart to the elevator and take it down to level A. Turn right into the hallway and take another right out to the double doors that lead to the loading dock. Exit the building and be sure to close both doors- these doors cannot be propped open.
-Wheel the cart to the gate. Use the small gold key to open the lock holding together the chains that lock the gate closed. Once you have the gate open, carry the hazards bin inside.
-Take out the hazards bag and tie it closed. Leave the tied hazards bag in one of the red bins in the corner.
-Bring the hazards bin back to the gray cart. Use the gold key to lock the chains and gate back up.\\
-Use the large gold key to reenter through the double doors. Take the elevator back to floor 1. Head back to HPL.
-Once back in HPL, find a new hazards bag- the Brain and Body Lab hazards bags are located on the first shelf above our space in the corner. If we run out, Dr.~Robles kindly invited us to use the Hazards bags in the HPL space which are located underneath the tables by the refrigerator.\\
-Discard your gloves into the newly replaced hazards bag.\\
-Make sure to return the Hazards keys to the lock box in BABLAB.

\subsubsection{Data Audit}\label{data-audit}}

\textbf{Before reaching out to participants}

It is important to check that information marked as missing on the participant's Trello card is \emph{actually} missing before reaching out to participant to request it.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Check for the missing information in the participant's folder on Box
\item
  If a REDCap survey is missing check if it was maybe just not input on REDCap but is there in participant folder
\item
  Look through email threads with participant for info on why a file might be missing or if they sent it to us in the past
\item
  If it is info the researcher collected during the session ( height, weight, waist) check if researcher has that info
\end{itemize}

IF the information is actually missing then you can go ahead and reach out to the participant

\begin{itemize}
\item
  You will be sending them editable copies of the files they are missing. It is advised you create some way to track each file ( ex. you can name file as date of session and then delete that name later on)
\item
  There is an email template available in the BAB email under templates titled ``MBB\_O - Data Audits Mind Brain Body Study''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Timeline for Data Audits:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Call participant and request missing information from them (surveys, contact list, etc). After calling ( and leaving a voicemail if they don'tt answer) send them an email requesting they fill out missing info and upload it to our \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/f/3c52df2afb1a446ab363b793f8af22c1}{Box folder}
\item
  \emph{One week later} call them again and send another email. Leave a voicemail if they don't answer.
\item
  \emph{One week later} call them again and send a third email. Leave a voicemail if they don't answer. At this point if you have not heard from them \emph{at all} you can end the audit for that person.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    if you \emph{have} heard from participant but haven't gotten the missing info then extend the audit a week or two at your discrection if you think they will complete the missing info.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{The folder for Box uploads is in BABLAB/Studies/Mind\_Brain\_Body/Data/Wave\_1\_online/Uploads} Check it to see if participant's have uploaded the missing info

\textbf{After each contact}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Make sure you write in the description the date you reached out to participant and any notes from the contact
\item
  If the participant did not seem willing to provide the missing info make a note
\item
