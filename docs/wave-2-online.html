<h3>W2 Checklist - Initial Online</h3>
<p><strong>Calling participants from REDCap</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Participants can be considered “recontact in a month” if they meet all of the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Researcher has tried to contact individual at different times of day.</li>
<li>Researcher has used at least 3 different approaches (e.g. email, phone, text message), UNLESS only 2 forms of contact have been given, in which case participant should fully meet all other criteria.</li>
<li>Researcher has been reaching out for two weeks ( contact at least every three days in some format)<br />
</li>
<li>Situation is NOT considered “phone tag” (a participant calls and lab member returns call but keeps missing one another- this shows participant may still be interested, therefore number of contact and lack of response may not be due to lack of interest. Participants in “phone tag” situation should stay on contact list).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Reminders</strong></p>
<p><strong>Calendar</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Put the W2 for wave two ( e.g. S1 W2 ) on session events</li>
<li>For reminder emails put Status: Incomplete in description</li>
<li>For Session 1 Reminder 1 call event put “Only if no email response” in the description and then status: Incomplete</li>
<li>Whenever you complete a reminder event mark it as complete and update the MBB participant log</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Emails to participants</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All emails to a participant should be in the same thread<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Remember that email templates need to be edited</strong>(e.g. there are no written responses in wave 2 so that chunk should be deleted, there is no ASA in wave 1 so that should be deleted in wave 1, etc.)</li>
<li>The thread we initially contacted them at should be the one we send the session confirmation to<br />
</li>
<li>The easiest way to not forget steps is to do all “session has just been scheduled” tasks based on the MBB log<br />
</li>
<li>Make sure you are sending the correct reminder email - S1 R2 is the one with the researcher card</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Confirming sessions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not put as “confirmed session” on MBB log unless we got verbal confirmation / email confirmation</li>
<li>If called and no answer leave a note on the calendar event saying was not able to verbally confirm &amp; also put into SRA chat</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>REDCap</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you schedule a new MBB participant change their SMBB “Wave 2 status” to enrolled<br />
</li>
<li>Make a new screening entry every time you schedule a participant</li>
<li><strong>For participant instrument - Age should be the age of participant at the time of <em>Session 1</em> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scheduling and Confirmation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Schedule session 1 two weeks in advance from “package mailing day” (see package preparation in pre-session checklist)</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule session 2 ~one week after session 1</p></li>
<li><p>Ask lab manager to make Zoom link with scheduled session times and save to google calendar</p></li>
<li><p>Send session 1 confirmation email (in templates)</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach <a href="https://app.box.com/file/776654994352">Infographic</a>, <a href="https://app.box.com/file/774936561660">Next Steps</a>, <a href="https://ucla.app.box.com/file/680632734387">Computer Zoom Download Instructions</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enrollment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create participant Box folder using MBB_template<br />
</li>
<li>Enroll participant in Wave 2 on REDCap
<ul>
<li>Go to “Add / Edit Records” of MBB</li>
<li>Make sure the tab is “Arm 3: wave 2”</li>
<li>Type in their MBB</li>
<li>Be careful because any premature clicking makes a new ID</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fill participant instrument on REDCap
<ul>
<li><strong>Age should be the age of participant at the time of <em>Session 1</em> </strong></li>
<li>In notes section add the date and time of session, recollected surveys needed &amp; any relevant info from scheduling call<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Essential to fill out the “Is this wave 2” question</strong></li>
<li>Look at ID drive or wave 1 data entry participant log for participant info ( age, sex, family ID, els or bio)</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Check for note on whether or not parent wanted questionnaires to be given online or on paper, adjust script accordingly</li>
<li>the participant info should also contain info about whether there are recollected surveys to administer (both that parent received in parent survey packet or child surveys we’ll administer in session)</li>
<li>If there is a child survey that needs to be recollected get the survey code so that it can be easily accessed during session</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Check to see if they did blood sample last year, it’s in the participant log on the Wave 1 - Data Entry sheet.
<ul>
<li>If they didn’t last year it might be really helpful to explain arm poke in detail early on, during initial presentation, before they consent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Open Slack and keep open for entirety of session for communication with the research team/Lab Manager</li>

<li>There will be a script on REDCap for making calls, just follow the script.</li>
<li>We are not rescreening them, the call will be just for letting them know we’re now in wave 2 and scheduling their session</li>
<li>All attempts at contacting participant including reaching out to the individuals on their contact lists should be documented as a screening on REDCap. Make sure to always make a note of voicemail left, email sent etc.</li>
<li>Remember to change the recontect date after each contact attempt and to lock each screening so there is unaltered record of who reached out and when.</li>
<li><strong>Parents will verbally opt in to text reminders at the time of screen call which will be their “consent” to be texted.</strong></li>

- Know the month they participated in Wave 1 so you can reference that in the call. ( Ex. you participated in wave 1 of our study back in January 2020) </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>1st attempt – call #1 and if no answer leave a voicemail ( script on REDCap) and send template email #1</li>
<li>2nd attempt ( 4 days later ) – call #2 and if no answer leave a voicemail ( script on REDCap) &amp; also send a text message ( <em>Hi, this is the Brain and Body lab at UCLA.

<h3>W2 Protocol - Welcome &amp; Zoom Introduction</h3>
<p>[ONCE ZOOM IS CONNECTED]</p>
<p><em>Hi! Thank you so much for joining us today! We are so looking forward to today’s session with you. </em></p>
<p><em>Our session today should take around 2 hours long. In addition to what we do here today, there will be a follow up zoom appointment with us one week from now. At that appointment, we will reconnect on a second Zoom call in which your child will log on for 15 minutes and complete a computer game.</em></p>
<p><em>I’ll be sending a message to the chat box just to make sure everything is working. You may already know this, but you can also display your camera so that it is in gallery view or speaker view in the top right corner. I think it might be best for you to do speaker view so it will feel more like we are in the room together!</em></p>
<p><em>If for any reason, we lose each other over Zoom, the connection seems to be bad, or one of us freezes, lets leave the session and try to reconnect on the same link again. If I am frozen- feel free to leave and come back. If you leave and I don’t see you come back, I will try to give you a phone call!</em></p>
<p><em>How does that sound? Do you have any questions?</em></p>
<p>[If no, say] <em>Great! Let’s switch gears and talk a little bit about what we are going to do today. Let me just pull up a little presentation we have got!</em></p>
<p>Researcher to open up the <a href="https://app.box.com/file/777489326925">MBB_W2_Consent_Script_Presentation</a>]</p>
</div>
<div id="w2-protocol---consent-assent-online" class="section level3">
<h3>W2 Protocol - Consent &amp; Assent Online</h3>
<p><em>Before we begin, I just wanted to let you know that in this study, we ask a lot of questions about family life and tough things that might have happened to kids. We are going to ask these questions to you and we ask a couple to your children as well, we just want to let you know that it is in our protocol to make sure everyone is safe, so if you or your child reveals to us that you’re at current risk of harm or if you’re at risk of harming someone else, then we will follow up with you and make sure everything is okay. If it is not, then we will take some steps to make sure that we keep everyone safe.</em></p>
<p><em>First thing we are going to do is go over what is on the consent and assent forms. (These are the attached documents we sent you in the emails leading up to this session.) We will walk through, in a little bit more detail, all of the things we will be doing during today’s session.</em></p>
<p><em>During today’s online session we are going to be doing some interactive things. First, we are going to have you and your parent sit and talk about some not so fun things and some fun things while on ZOOM. This conversation will be recorded but we will not be watching or listening in</em></p>
<p><em>Next, we are going to have you play a game on the computer. In this game, you will be looking at pictures. Some of the pictures will be a bit scary, some sad, others a bit boring. While you are playing this game, your parent will stay with you in the room but will be working on some surveys to fill out.</em></p>
<p><em>After the game is over, your parent [NAME] will help measure your height, weight, and waist circumference.</em></p>
<p><em>You will also be answering some surveys (for children) with the researcher OR (for teens) on your own.</em></p>
<p><em>Lastly for today, your parent will help take two biological samples during this session.</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>One is the hair sample which helps measure hormones that everyone has in their hair</p></li>
<li><p>Two is the split sample which helps tell us learn a little bit more about your microbiome</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do you know what a microbiome is?</p></li>
<li><p>A microbiome is all the little bacteria that live inside your mouth. Everyone has these, they are healthy! We just want to know what kind and how many of each there are.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><em>For helping us out in today’s session, you will be getting $30 for the work you put in! After this online session is over, we’ll ask you to do four more things in the second session:</em></p>
<p><em>1. One is the Child poop sample – this helps us learn a bit more about your microbiome</em></p>
<p><em>- There are also little bacteria that live in your tummy! Everyone has these and we want to know more about them.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Two is filling out the stool scale – this is a short scale that gives a description of your sample</em></p>
<p><em>3. Three is the computer memory game – this is when you will log back on with us via ZOOM in a week’s time to see what you remember from today’s session</em></p>
<p><em>4. Four is the blood sample – this helps us look at immune markers which are very important for interpreting microbiome system because those systems talk to each other</em></p>
<p><em>Great! Do you have any questions for us about any of the samples</em></p>
<p><em>Later in the year when things are safer, we would like you to invite you to come in for an optional brain scan using the MRI machine. You don’t have to decide whether you want to do that now, but we just wanted to mention it here.</em></p>
<p><em>You will receive $20 for doing the poop sample and $15 more for doing the blood sample!</em></p>
<p><em>We will send the full payment of $65 ($30 for today’s session, $20 for the poop sample, and $15 for the blood sample) as soon as we receive the samples back through the mail.</em></p>
<p><em>Here are some things to keep in mind:</em></p>
<p><em>You are a volunteer in this study, which means you do not have to do anything, or say anything, that makes you uncomfortable. We would like you to try everything you can, and to do your best, but if there are things you absolutely do not want to do, just tells us, that is o.k.</em></p>
<p><em>Another thing we want to remind you is that nothing you do today is a TEST!! We want you to try your best, but there is no “right” or “wrong” answers in anything you do today. We just want to learn about you!</em></p>
<p><em>We will keep your participation confidential. You are given an ID number in order to keep your data confidential and separated from your name. Therefore, any identifying information (like your name, email, address, etc.) will be kept private and not paired with your data. We will also use a secondary ID number to save the videos with (since your faces are in it), which will help separate this from your name and the other data we collect form you. Only members of our research team will have access to your name and ID numbers.</em></p>
<p><em>I will rename your “ZOOM Name” right now with your Secondary ID number, to prepare for the recordings we will take in our session today</em></p>
<p>[Researcher will rename the participant’s name to “P” for participant. ]</p>
<p><em>Ok- I will now send you a link through the Zoom chat, which will open up a survey that allows you to virtually indicate your consent to participate in the study. Please feel free to take your time reading through the consent and assent forms now if you’d like. As I mentioned earlier, these are the documents we had previously sent you in the emails leading up to today’s session.</em></p>
<p>[Bottom of consent form has the information about the arm poke, make sure to mention that and note whether they consent]</p>
<p>[Then once they are done reading through]</p>
<p><em>All set and any questions?</em></p>
<p>[IF NO,] <em>Please click to indicate yours and your child’s consent/assent and verbally let us know each of the items you have consented/not consented for, so we can adjust the session in case there is something you/your child may not feel up for today!</em></p>
<p><em>You may press submit once you are finished to “send in the form.”</em></p>
<p>Researcher to grab magic box.</p>
<p><em>Once you are all set with that, we’d like you for to grab the magic box we sent you in the mail. This contains everything you will need for today’s session and what you will do as apart of Session 2 as well.</em></p>
<p><em>If you haven’t already done so, please open the magic box up. The magic box should contain a sheet of paper at the top which details all of the contents, but we will let you know when you need to take each item out of the box. Please set aside the magic box for now but keep the materials near you as we may need to access materials from the magic box throughout today’s session!</em></p>
<p><em>What you can pull out now and use throughout the session is the Reward Board and Gold Star Stickers. Use this reward board to track all the steps you accomplish today! Each space is like each task for the session. Once you complete the task you can put a gold star on the space!</em></p>
<p><em>Are you ready to get started on the session? Great, lets dive in!</em></p>

<div id="w2-protocol---parent-child-observation-online" class="section level3">
<h3>W2 Protocol - Parent Child Observation Online</h3>
<p>The parent and child will be seated together in view on the Zoom camera. During that time they will be filmed while solving a conflict, and then again while discussing a pleasant event. The conflict event will always go first, followed by the pleasant event. We did this to ensure that the parents were not thinking of the negative interaction upon answering the questionnaires about their child, which they did immediately after the observation interaction.</p>
<p>[RESEARCHER SHOULD ASSESS VOLUME. If participant volume is too low, recording will not pick it up. Ensure that volume is at an appropriate frequency before proceeding to PC interaction recordings.]</p>
<p>[RESEARCHER SHOULD CHANGE TO SPEAKER VIEW. Participants should be in speaker view so recording will enlarge the parent and child for behavior analysis.]</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>The researcher will ask the parent to find the <a href="https://ucla.app.box.com/file/630327764749">Pleasant/Unpleasant Events Checklist</a> piece of paper from their session package.</p>
<p><em>Researcher: So the first thing we will have you pull out of the magic box is the paper packet titled “Online Session Booklet.” You can flip to the page that says “Issues Checklist.”</em></p>
<p>Researcher will wait for the participant to find the Online Session Booklet and flip to the correct page.</p>
<p><em>Researcher: Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss something that’s hard and try to resolve it. On this piece of paper (Issues Checklist) is a list of things that parents and children sometimes have disagreements about. We will give you a moment to read the list and think about some that you would like to discuss together. Then after about one minute, you will start discussing the things you have selected and try to resolve them. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from this list, or decide to choose something else. Please choose something you can try to resolve (not an emotionally charged topic that would be difficult to discuss together right now). And we want you to remember- this is not a test and there are no right or wrong things to say!</em></p>
<p><em>I am going to turn off my camera and mute myself to be out of the recording, and I will also turn my volume down low and will not be listening in closely. I will come back in and let you know when the six minutes are all done!</em></p>
<p><em>When you are ready, I will begin the recording and give you a total of 6 minutes- one minute or so to choose, then five minutes to discuss! Are you ready?</em></p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Researcher will ensure Zoom security settings are set up for the video.</p></li>
<li><p>Parent and child will be situated side-by-side in view on the Zoom camera.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>-Researcher will press record on the Zoom application. Wait to hear the audio Zoom confirmation <em>“this meeting is now being recorded”</em> and view recording in progress at top left of screen to ensure recording is live.</p>
<ul>
<li>Researcher set timer for 6 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Researcher will mute themselves on Zoom and turn off their camera, and step out of the room.</p></li>
<li><p>Researcher will start timer for 6 minutes. At the end of 6 minutes, reenter camera view and unmute themselves.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>[After 6 minutes have passed, say] <em>Thank you for taking the time to discuss something difficult. Next we are going to take some film of you talking about something nice. You can flip to the page that says “Pleasant Events Checklist.” On your “Pleasant Events Checklist” is a list of fun things that parents and children sometimes do together. I will give you a moment to read the list and pick something that you would like to plan to do together. Then after about one minute, you will start discussing the things you have selected and try to plan them. Again, you do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you choose something from this list, or decide to choose something else. When you are ready, I will start the recording and then give you a minute to choose and five minutes to discuss!</em></p>
<p><em>I will be give you six minutes in total, one minute to choose and 5 minutes to discuss- remember, try to plan whatever fun thing you talk about during those five minutes. After, I will come back into the video call and give you further instructions. Do you have any questions?</em></p>
<p>If no questions, proceed.</p>
<p>Step 5:</p>
<ul>
<li>Researcher will start timer for 6 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>After six minutes, researcher reenters the room and back into camera view, turns up volume on the computer, and stops the recording on Zoom. You will view this notification in the upper right hand corner that states the recorded file will be converted to mp4 once the meeting ends. Move the child/adolescent and parent onto the next task in the session, as the video will not be saved until after the session is complete.</li>
</ul>

<h3>W2 Protocol - Halloween Training/Parent Questionnaires</h3>
<p><em>Now we are done with the group activity. You can go ahead and take out your token board and gold star stickers, and stick one golden star on the first block, where the movie icon is!</em></p>
<p><em>Next we will move on to some individual activities, where Mom/Dad will complete some surveys while you [Child’s name] plays a computer game. The computer game is about your child’s learning and memory so it is important they don’t get help from you! We actually prefer you don’t watch the screen so you don’t know which pictures they see. If you recall the example from our powerpoint at the beginning of this session, this will be the time that your child will see some pictures on the screen</em></p>
<p><strong>[If the parent decided to fill out questionnaires on paper, say]</strong>
<em>While your child is doing the game, you can get started on some parent surveys. So now I will ask you to reach into your Session Package and pull out the booklets titled “Parent Proxy Surveys” and “Parent Self Surveys” and a pencil to fill these out.</em>
<em>We ask that you please fill the parent proxy surveys first and then parent self surveys. Some of these surveys are about your child and some of these surveys are about you. The game will take around 5-10 minutes and I will notify you when we are finished. You can go ahead and work on the surveys now while your child plays the game.</em></p>
<p><strong>[If the parent decided to fill out questionnaires online, say]</strong>
<em>While your child is doing the game, you can get started on some parent surveys. So now I will ask you to grab your secondary device and log into the “links email” I sent just before the start of our session. In that email, you will find two links and two codes- one for parent proxy surveys and another for parent self surveys.</em>
<em>We ask that you please fill the parent proxy surveys first and then parent self surveys. Some of these surveys are about your child and some of these surveys are about you. In addition to these two sets, there is a short packet of paper surveys to complete- these are recollected surveys that you may not have finished from wave 1 of our study.</em>
<em>The game will take around 5-10 minutes and I will notify you when we are finished. You can go ahead and work on the surveys now while your child plays the game.</em></p>
<p><em>I will now just give [Child’s name] some instructions on the computer game. Let me share my screen so I can show you some examples!</em></p>
<p>Researcher to open up the <a href="https://app.box.com/file/784726680410">halloween_training</a>]</p>
<p><em>Ok, [Child’s name]- so in this computer game, you are going to go on a trick-or-treating adventure! First, you will be shown instructions that look just like this! The places you will be visiting are scenes that either have a toy or food. Your job is to do their best to remember what toy or food is with what scene.</em></p>
<p><em>Here is an examples of what you might see</em></p>
<p><em>In this picture, you are at a park and you got pancakes!</em></p>
<p><em>Here is another example.</em></p>
<p><em>In this picture, you are at a dark forest and you got a pogo stick!</em></p>
<p><em>Sometimes you will get food while other times you will get a toy, and sometimes you will be visiting a nice place while other times you will be visiting a scary one. Remember that the type of food or toy will vary and where it is found will differ. You will only be shown the photos for a few seconds, so do your best to memorize what food or toy goes with each place as quickly and as much as possible!</em></p>
<p><em>We also want to make sure you are paying attention, so when you see this red triangle, we want you to hit the space bar (or click the square)!</em></p>
<p><em>You will be reaching a halfway point where you can just click “continue”</em></p>
<p><em>There are TWO PARTS to this game- we are only going to be doing PART 1 right now. So, it is super important that when you see the page that says you’re finished with this part, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!</em></p>
<p>[Researcher to stop sharing screen.]</p>
<p><em>So to get setup for the computer game, we will send you a link through the Zoom chat now. Let me know once the link has loaded.</em></p>
<p>[Researcher to send Gorilla task link through the chat, then wait for them to pull it up.]</p>
<p>If necessary - the link can be found <a href="https://research.sc/participant/login/39409/publicid">here</a>.</p>
<p>[Then, confirm they are on the right page] <em>You should be seeing a login screen that asks you to enter your primary participant ID screen.</em></p>
<p><em>Ok! If you are ready to start, we will just have you or Mom/Dad click “Log in” on [Child’s name]’s page, and you can get started!</em></p>

<p><em>In part A you will be shown food or a toy and will be asked if you saw that food or toy when you went trick-or-treating. This is where your memory kicks in!</em></p>
<p><em>Here are some examples of what you might see.</em></p>
<p><em>In this case you are shown a pancake and asked did you see this while you were trick-or-treating</em></p>
<p><em>If you answer yes or no you will then be asked how sure are you that you saw that food or toy.</em></p>
<p><em>Part B shows the scenes that you visited and asks what food or toy was found there and where it was located on the screen.</em></p>
<p><em>Here are examples of what this looks like!</em></p>
<p><em>You will be shown a picture like this and asked which of the three choices you saw at that place.</em></p>

<li><p>Explain how the sample is used to measure a hormone called cortisol that is present in the hair.</p></li>
<li><p>Show on the hair sample picture directions sheet the hair sample taken from the wig to illustrate the amount of hair that will be collected (30-50 strands).</p></li>
<li><p>Offer to show our hair sample collection video if the parent would like a more comprehensive visual.</p></li>
<li><p>After taking the sample, the parent will tape it to the aluminum foil. When doing this, it is VERY important to place the tape at least 3cm below the root end. To show the parent how long 3cm is, you can use the measuring tape provided, or tell them it is 1.5 inches (really closer to 4cm but better longer than shorter).</p></li>
<li><p>If hair kit included painters tape, ensure that at least 3 cm of root is above the painters tape, and that the tape does NOT cover the root. If hair is shorter than 3cm, instruct not to use the tape.</p></li>
<li><p>If hair kit included rubber band, ensure that rubber band is put on hair PRIOR to cutting. The rubber hand then helps secure the bunched hair in the foil after hair sample is taken.</p></li>
<li><p>When they are ready to package the hair sample, ensure that the foil does not fold at the root- this is a very sensitive area in which we are analyzing, and important not to damage!</p></li>
<li><p>When finished, hair sample should be put in the foil, in the ziploc bag, in the white box along with the other samples</p></li>

<div id="hair-length" class="section level4">
<h4>Hair Length</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>For short hair (less than or just above 3cm, i.e., too short to tape and still have 3cm usable), follow the Short-Hair Protocol below.</p></li>
<li><p>For longer hair (&gt;3cm), follow the Longer-Hair Protocol below.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally, hair samples should be at least 3cm long. If the hair is less than 1cm long, the sample cannot be used.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Short-Hair Protocol (1-3cm)- advise parent to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Select a portion of hair from the posterior vertex of the head (in line with ears is a good reference point).</p></li>
<li><p>Use the rattail comb to thin out the hair as much as possible, so that the parent is grasping a horizontal line of hair rather than a chunk.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that 30-50 strands are included in the portion being held.</p></li>
<li><p>Hold the loose hair tightly with index finger and thumb, and cut the hair along the part, as close to the scalp and as evenly as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Place loose hairs in foil and fold it securely. Do NOT tape the hair to the foil.</p></li>
<li><p>Fold the foil without bending the hair, and ensure that the hair does not fall out of the foil.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the root-end on the aluminum foil is labeled and place it in the ziplock bag.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the ziplock bag is labeled with the participant’s ID and Wave.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Longer-Hair Protocol (&gt;3 cm) - advise parent to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Take the comb and part the hair horizontally between the tips of the ears.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a clip to clip away the hair from the top of the parting.</p></li>
<li><p>Instruct the parent to grasp approx. 30-50 strands of hair under the hair that has been clipped up.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the rattail comb to thin out the hair as much as possible, so that the parent is grasping a horizontal line of hair rather than a chunk. After this step, ensure the parent is still grasping 30-50 strands.</p></li>
<li><p>Instruct the parent to cut the hair sample as close to the scalp as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Attach the hair to the center of the aluminum foil by taping with painter’s tape - leave at least 3 cm of hair from the root end; not cover the root end.</p></li>
<li><p>If parent does not know how much 3cm is, you can: say that they can measure it with the cm side of the measuring tape; if they know inches say it is about 1.5 inches (really closer to 4cm but better too long than too short); or offer to demonstrate based on the length of your own finger.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the hair inside the aluminum foil in the orientation indicated by the “root” written on the foil.</p></li>
<li><p>Fold the foil without bending the hair, and ensure that the hair does not fall out of the foil.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the folded foil in the ziplock bag.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the ziploc bag back in the magic box.</p></li>

<li>Safety glasses</li>
<li>Surgical Mask</li>
<li>Closed-toe shoes</li>
<li>Long pants</li>
<li>Hair tied back</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Prepare your station and ensure that you have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incubator with thermometer</li>
<li>Vortex machine</li>
<li>Eppendorf pipette (1000uL)</li>
<li>Pipette tips (wide bore, sterile, universal fit)</li>
<li>2.0mL cryogenic vials (with O rings, sterile)</li>
<li>Saliva samples in room temperature plastic box<br />
</li>
<li>Test tube rack</li>
<li>Transport box with divider</li>
<li>Industrial Sharpie for labeling</li>
<li>Notebook for sample logs with pen</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps for incubation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve the box of saliva samples at room temperature in BAB Lab Cabinet 1 and carry them to HPL.</li>
<li>Plug in and turn on the incubator, turn the dial to level 10 and ensure the red “heating light” is on.</li>
<li>Continuously check the incubator to see what if temperature has reached 50-55C.</li>
<li>While waiting for the incubator to hit 50 C, clean workspace using ethynol and paper towels (dispose these in the regular trash bin)</li>
<li>Open the saliva sample box in HPL and note down the list of samples to be processed today, and ensure the lid on each of these samples is shut very tight. If the lid is slightly opened, the sample may risk evaporation during incubation.</li>
<li>Ensure you are wearing gloves when grabbing the 2.0mL cryovials. Label two cryovials per sample for those that will be processed today (use the Industrial Sharpie). Place them in the transport box for temporary storage.</li>
<li>When the incubator has reached 50C, turn down the heat to level 6. The incubator temperature will still rise slowly, but when the door is opened for samples to be put in, the temperature can drop anywhere between 5-10C, depending upon how long the door is opened. To account for this temperature loss, heat the incubator to about 55C.</li>
<li>When the temperature reaches 55C, open the incubator door and place all saliva tubes standing upright on the incubator tray.</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> the incubator is extremely sensitive to movement - the saliva samples are likely to fall over with any large tap and/or placement of saliva samples on the tray inside. Be very careful placing samples onto the tray, closing the incubator door, and opening the incubator door once the incubation has completed.</li>
<li>Close the incubator door <em>very</em> carefully and turn the knob as needed to regulated the temperature towards 50C. If the heat has dropped significantly, turn to level 10. If the heat has dropped slightly, move towards 6-8. If the heat is still too high, drop to level 2-4. If the heat is about right, keep the knob at level 5.</li>
<li>Note down the current time and set an alarm for 2 hours to continue processing. Continue to check the incubator regularly to ensure temperature level is still at 50C and heat level does not need adjusting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps for processing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once the tubes have incubated for 2 hours, retrieve the cryovials, test tube rack, pipettes, pipette tips, and sample log notebook with pen.</li>
<li><strong>Very carefully</strong>, open the incubator door and remove five samples to place in the test tube rack. Close the incubator door. (NOTE: the samples are not very hot, so no additional safety protection is needed beyond gloves. If extremely sensitive to heat touch, use a paper towel to grab the samples out of the incubator.)</li>
<li>Carry the five samples in the test tube rack to the vortex machine. Place one sample on the vortex machine and press down, holding for 20 seconds while the sample is shaken.</li>
<li>After each sample is vortexed, turn the sample upside down and back up to see if any is still too viscous. If so, vortex for an additional 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Carry the samples back to the Pipettes in the BAB area of HPL. Select the 1000uL pipette and spin the dial until the numbers on the back of the pipette read 1000. Open the box of pipette tips.</li>
<li><strong>PIPETTING SAMPLE:</strong> Locate the labeled cryovials for the sample you will process. Open the sample tube and place back down into the test tube holder. Open the cryovial and hold tube with one hand. Grab the pipette, push down into a new pipette tip, place into sample, press down until first stop, release to suck in first 1000uL. Release the sample into the cryovial, pressing down until second stop. Place pipette down on its side. Close the cryovial and place back into transfer box. Open the second cryovial, pipette what is left from the saliva sample into the second cryovial before placing into the transfer box. When there is no saliva left in the sample tube, close it and dispose in the biohazard bin. Release the pipette tip by pressing on the button located on the back of the pipette into the biohazard bin. Write down the sample quality and location in the sample log notebook.</li>
<li>Wipe down the table with ethynol before replacing gloves, disposing in biohazard bin.</li>
<li>Return to the incubator for the next five samples, repeating the <strong>PIPETTING SAMPLE</strong> step above for the rest of the samples.</li>
<li>Once the samples have been processed, transfer the samples to the -20 freezer in the saliva box.</li>
<li>Turn the knob on the incubator back to zero, and turn the incubator off. If researcher would like to return the incubtaor to room temperature quick, the incubator door may be opened to release heat faster.</li>
<li>Take a picture of the sample log notebook and transfer notes to the sample log on Box</li>

<h4>Taking out the Hazards</h4>
<p>-Take the Hazards key with you from the lock box in the Lab. Make sure there are two keys attached- a large gold key and a small gold key.
-Head to HPL. Once inside, put on PPE.
-Find the large gray cart in the back room, and wheel into the main HPL lab space. This will assist you in carrying the Hazards bin to the waste area. Put the entire Hazards bin (with the hazards bag full of materials) onto the gray cart.<br />
-Ensure you either leave the HPL keys in the lockbox on the door or take them with you.
-Wheel the cart to the elevator and take it down to level A. Turn right into the hallway and take another right out to the double doors that lead to the loading dock. Exit the building and be sure to close both doors- these doors cannot be propped open.
-Wheel the cart to the gate. Use the small gold key to open the lock holding together the chains that lock the gate closed. Once you have the gate open, carry the hazards bin inside.
-Take out the hazards bag and tie it closed. Leave the tied hazards bag in one of the red bins in the corner.
-Bring the hazards bin back to the gray cart. Use the gold key to lock the chains and gate back up.<br />
-Use the large gold key to reenter through the double doors. Take the elevator back to floor 1. Head back to HPL.
-Once back in HPL, find a new hazards bag- the Brain and Body Lab hazards bags are located on the first shelf above our space in the corner. If we run out, Dr. Robles kindly invited us to use the Hazards bags in the HPL space which are located underneath the tables by the refrigerator.<br />
-Discard your gloves into the newly replaced hazards bag.<br />
-Make sure to return the Hazards keys to the lock box in BABLAB.</p>
