### W1-O Checklist - Scheduling Stage

**Calling participants from REDCap**

- Participants can be considered "lost to follow up" if they meet all of the following criteria:
  - Researcher has tried to contact individual at different times of day.
  - Researcher has used at least 2 different approaches (e.g. email and phone), UNLESS only 1 form of contact has been given, in which case participant should fully meet all other criteria.
  - Person has been contact at least 4 times. 
  - Situation is NOT considered "phone tag" (a participant calls and lab member returns call but keeps missing one another- this shows participant may still be interested, therefore number of contact and lack of response may not be due to lack of interest. Participants in "phone tag" situation should stay on contact list).

**Waitlist criteria**

- This regards the “out of town” option on the wave1_Status on REDCap
- Should include:
  - any participants here live outside of LA, and won’t be coming back to LA (e.g. did not relocate just for COVID-19 pandemic purposes)
  - participants whose age tally exceed 10, the target collection number for each age group in our age range. Refer to the [Participant Tally](https://ucla.app.box.com/file/724688028024) for reference. 

**PLEASE NOTE: Participants who have not aged out yet, or who are not free at the moment yet, OR live outside the US but plan to come back as soon as the pandemic is over should all still be kept on the contact log and just have a future recontact date. We only want to put people who are going on our  “out of town” waitlist (like a plan B, only contact if necessary)!**

We will only refer to the waitlist if (1) we will be behind on recruitment for Wave 1 and will need to just schedule people who we know cannot come back for future waves to complete data collection or (2) we will be behind on recruitment for Wave 1 and will need to just schedule people who are anywhere within our age range, rather than targeted numbers by age to complete data collection (3) we have to stay in the pandemic and all future waves will be remote. 

**Important Reminders**

  **Screening**
  
  - Check participant tally before screening to know if we would be scheduling or waitlisting if they qualify 
  - When answering the call ask who you are speaking with ( so we know if it’s a parent or teen)
  - If a potential participant is not of age then put their recontact to future around the time they would qualify 
  - If screening a family with multiple children each child has to be screened with their own smbb
    - Oldest child gets next available smbb number just like the mbb number protocol 
    - Only exception is if we only knew about younger child then during screening mentions they have another child that wants to participate.
  - Triple check you write down the address correctly for participants ( repeat it back to them / spell it out) 
  - Do not run session until you are 100% sure they are eligible. If unsure of a criteria verify it before session. 

  **Calendar**
  
  - Put the W1 for wave one ( e.g. S1 W1 ) on session events
  - For reminder emails put Status: Incomplete in description
  - For Session 1 Reminder 1 call event put “Only if no email response” in the description and then status: Incomplete
  - Whenever you complete a reminder event mark it as complete and update the MBB participant log 
  
  **Emails to participant**
  
  - Move potential participant email to “Added” tab of MBB once you add them to the participant database 
  - All emails to a participant should be in the same thread 
    - The thread we initially contacted them at should be the one we send the session confirmation to   
      - **Remember that email templates need to be edited**(e.g. there are no written responses in wave 2 so that chunk should be deleted, there is no ASA in wave 1 so that should be deleted in wave 1, etc.)
  - The easiest way to not forget steps is to do all “ session has just been scheduled” tasks based on the MBB log 
  - Make sure you are sending the correct reminder email - S1 R2 is the one with the researcher card 
  
  **Confirming sessions**
  
  - Do not put as “ confirmed session” on MBB log unless we got verbal confirmation / email confirmation
  - If called and no answer leave a note on the calendar event saying was not able to verbally confirm & also put into SRA chat 
  
  **REDCap** 
  
  - Log into REDCap with your own account to avoid confusion and for easier identification of who screened each smbb participant
  - After contacting someone change the Wave status “date to recontact”  to one week from the current date ( can be two weeks if it’s someone that hasn’t responded in long time)
  - When you schedule a new MBB participant change their SMBB “Wave 1 status” to enrolled 


**Scheduling and Confirmation**

- Schedule session 1 two weeks in advance from "package mailing day" (see package preparation in pre-session checklist)
- Schedule session 2 ~one week after session 1
- Ask Lab Manager to make Zoom link with scheduled session times and save to google calendar
- Send session 1 confirmation email (in templates)
   - Attach [Next Steps](https://ucla.app.box.com/file/665452959932), [Computer Zoom Download Instructions](https://ucla.app.box.com/file/680632734387)

- Enroll participant in Wave 1 on REDCap
  - Go to “Add / Edit Records” of MBB
  - Make sure the tab is “Arm 2: wave 1”
  - Type in the next available MBB

**General Notes about calendar**

Session 1 reminders

  - You can differentiate the Session 1 Reminder 1 and Reminder 2 emails by seeing if it says to include Research Profile ( reminder 2 is the one with the researcher profile)
  
  - the files you attach to the emails are in BABLAB/Studies/Mind_Brain_Body/Documents/Infographic_next_steps/Wave_1_online
  
  - consents are in BABLAB/Studies/Mind_Brain_Body/Documents/Consents/Wave_1_online
  
  - Research profiles are in BABLAB/Studies/Mind_Brain_Body/Documents/Infographic_next_steps and remember to drag the picture in show it shows up in the email body
  
  - When you call you're just asking them to confirm that the session date and time works for them & that they received package/ *Hi this is ____ from the Brain and Body Lab. I am calling to confirm you are still available for your session on ___. Also, have you received the package?* 
  
Session 2 Reminders

  - You can check if they consented to stool sample by looking at email thread to see the session @ confirmation email the researcher sent them OR you can go to their Session 1 checklist on REDCap
  
  - Make sure you only include relevant reminders in the email, delete the highlighted parts that don't apply to them
  
Home Session Reminders

  - Check the MBB participant log to see if we haev received their package. 
  
      - If the Package COnfirmation section is filled out as complete then we *have* received package. 
      
      - Lab manager also sends message to SRA to update on packages that are received so can search chat 
      
      - If still unsure if participant has sent package back to us check email thread
      
  - For home session reminders make sure to only send request if they haven't sent package back or are missing something
  
      - If we *did* receive package but something is missing ( contact list, BSS) then you would request it. Lab manager usually tells whoever is in charge of calendar if things were missing from packages that were received
      
Misc Notes

  - If the calendar event is for something else such as checking in with a participapant or rescheduling a session the lab manager or other memmber of team will provide the necessary context
  
  - If unsure about a particicular calendar event you can slack Lab manager or send a message to SRA to see if someone knows answer
  
  - Remember to mark as complete on calendar and on MBB participant log after doing each calendar event
