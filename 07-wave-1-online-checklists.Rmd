# Wave 1 Online

## Checklists Online

-----------

### Checklist - Initial Online

**Calling participants from REDCap**

- Participants can be considered "lost to follow up" if they meet all of the following criteria:
  - Researcher has tried to contact individual at different times of day.
  - Researcher has used at least 2 different approaches (e.g. email and phone), UNLESS only 1 form of contact has been given, in which case participant should fully meet all other criteria.
  - Person has been contact at least 4 times. 
  - Situation is NOT considered "phone tag" (a participant calls and lab member returns call but keeps missing one another- this shows participant may still be interested, therefore number of contact and lack of response may not be due to lack of interest. Participants in "phone tag" situation should stay on contact list).

**Waitlist criteria**

- This regards the “out of town” option on the wave1_Status on REDCap
- Should include:
  - any participants here live outside of LA, and won’t be coming back to LA (e.g. did not relocate just for COVID-19 pandemic purposes)
  - participants whose age tally exceed 15, the target collection number for each age group in our age range. Refer to the [Participant Tally](https://ucla.app.box.com/file/724688028024) for reference. 

**PLEASE NOTE: Participants who have not aged out yet, or who are not free at the moment yet, OR live outside the US but plan to come back as soon as the pandemic is over should all still be kept on the contact log and just have a future recontact date. We only want to put people who are going on our  “out of town” waitlist (like a plan B, only contact if necessary)!**

We will only refer to the waitlist if (1) we will be behind on recruitment for Wave 1 and will need to just schedule people who we know cannot come back for future waves to complete data collection or (2) we will be behind on recruitment for Wave 1 and will need to just schedule people who are anywhere within our age range, rather than targeted numbers by age to complete data collection (3) we have to stay in the pandemic and all future waves will be remote.
