## Summary

### Abstract

The Mind, Brain, Body (MBB) study examines links between early life
adversity (ELA), the gastrointestinal microbiome, memory and affective
neurodevelopment, across three years in middle childhood through
adolescence. The specific aims of this study are to (1) determine how
adversity affects developmental change in the microbiome in middle
childhood and adolescence, (2) establish associations between the
microbiome, memory development, and the hippocampus, and (3) identify
independent and joint influences of adversity exposure, the microbiome,
brain and memory performance on the emergence of anxiety symptoms across
development. We are recruiting N = 75 ELA exposed, and N = 75 not
adversity exposed (Comparison) children and adolescents to take part in
3 waves of data collection. Children in the ELA group must be 6-16 years
of age, while children in the comparison group must be 6-9 or 13-16
years of age. Participants complete a laboratory session (in-person or
online) in Wave 1-3, and also complete a neuroimaging session in Wave 2.
Study procedures for the laboratory session in Wave 1-3 remain similar.
For the ELA group, we are recruiting youth who were adopted from
institutional or foster care: previously institutionalized and who are
now adopted internationally (PI), adopted domestically from foster care
(DA). Comparison youth have not experienced these forms of early life
caregiving adversities (i.e., they have always been with their
biological parents). In addition to the primary aims of the MBB study,
described above, we are also collecting a range of supplemental
biological, questionnaire, and MRI measures aimed at assessing cognitive
and emotional functioning, family functioning, as well as immune,
biomarkers, and physical health assessments to aid in understanding the
mechanisms behind the specific aims under investigation. The MBB study
will test for links between the microbiome, memory, hippocampal
function, and anxiety across a three-year time frame in middle childhood
-- adolescence (6-16 years of age). Participants may opt out of the
study at any point in time but will be asked to participate in testing
every year until funding ceases (current grant funding this research --
R00 NIMH -- ends in 2022).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Aims

The study will test four primary and two supplemental hypotheses. The
primary hypotheses are: (H1) that there will be greater stability in
microbiome composition across 3 years in the ELA than Comparison group,
(H2) ELA will be associated with higher expression of anxiety symptoms
across time, (H3) the microbiome in Wave 1 will predict developmental
change in memory performance between Wave 1-3, and that hippocampal
activity during learning will mediate that association, (H4) that the
microbiome, hippocampal encoding patterns, and memory behavior
longitudinally mediate the adversity and anxiety association across
development. The supplemental hypotheses are: (SH1) that ELA will be
associated with a higher incidence of physical health (particularly
gastrointestinal) problems, as well as dysregulation in stress response
and immune systems, (SH2) that physical symptoms, stress response and
immune system will mediate the link between adversity exposure,
microbiome changes, hippocampal neurodevelopment, and memory.

### Background

An individuals early rearing history has a significant effect on their
emotional functioning across the lifespan. In particular, access to
consistent/stable caregivers is strongly associated with mental health
[@repetti_2002], and parent-related early adversities (e.g., abuse and
neglect) contribute to more than a third of mental illnesses [anxiety
being the most common diagnosis; @kessler_2005]. Clinical,
epidemiological and basic science suggests that two systems affected by
early adversity -- the gastrointestinal microbiome, and the hippocampal
memory system, are also consistently associated with the emergence and
maintenance of anxiety symptoms. Rodent and monkey models have
established that adversity alters microbial communities in the gut
[@bailey_1999; @bailey_2010; @omahony_2009] and that microbial
populations are causally related to the expression of anxious behaviors
[@collins_2013]. In humans too, microbiome-related gastrointestinal
disturbances (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome) and anxiety are highly
comorbid [@kennedy_2014; @callaghan_2019]. In terms of the memory
system, rodent studies show that typically weak memories in childhood
get stronger following adversity [@callaghan_2012a; callaghan_2012b;
@cowan_2013], and exposure to early stress promotes hippocampal synaptic
development [@huang_2005], which aids long-term memory persistence.
Memory dysfunction is key to maintaining anxiety disorders, which are
characterized by persistent and intrusive memories of
threat[@acheson_2012; @zlomuzica_2014], and hippocampal dysfunction is
common in anxiety disorders [@godsil_2013]. Importantly, hippocampal
development is causally tied to the microbiome in early life
[@callaghan_2016; @clarke_2013; @cowan_2016; @gareau_2011], suggesting
that interactions between these two systems could contribute to anxiety
emergence. Although microbial and hippocampal memory systems exert their
effects on anxiety in the context of one another, until now, they have
always been studied independently.

Using a completely novel longitudinal design, we will test the
hypothesis that changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome are
associated with early adverse caregiving and underlie altered
hippocampal development and memory functioning in middle childhood --
adolescence. Moreover, we will examine whether those microbial, and
neurodevelopmental changes mediate the progression towards anxiety
symptoms in early adversity exposed individuals. To answer these
questions, we will compare longitudinal data from a group of adolescents
who have experienced early caregiving adversity, to a group of
comparison youth who have not experienced those same events. The study
will involve examining the gastrointestinal microbiome (measured through
stool samples), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
understand hippocampal functional development. In addition, the study
will collect saliva and blood spot samples to assess saliva biomarkers
(e.g., cortisol, testosterone) and blood immune markers (e.g., CRP,
interleukins), as well as hair samples to assess chronic cortisol
exposure, which can be used to understand the mechanisms behind
microbiome-brain associations in youth.

## Procedure

All youth will be recruited through community settings, clinics (e.g.,
pediatricians office), specialized services (e.g., adoption services),
and through the internet (community boards, targeted advertisements).

Three assessments (spaced 12 months apart -- Wave 1-3) will occur with
youth who fall within the period of development in the hippocampal and
microbiome: 'children', and 'adolescents' aged 6-16 years. Biological
(stool, saliva, blood spots, hair), questionnaire, and behavioral data
will be collected in each wave of the study, and an fMRI scan will be
collected in Wave 2. Participants will be recruited who have either
experienced early life adversity (ELA) through adverse caregiving
(previously institutionalized, domestically adopted), or who have not
been exposed to those caregiving experiences (Comparison). A sample size
of N = 75 youth will be recruited into each of those groups, resulting
in a final target of N = 150 youth in the study (N = 37-38 in each of
the age groups = children versus adolescents, for the ELA and Comparison
groups at Wave 1). That target sample size takes attrition into account
across the longitudinal study (expected at 20%, to arrive at a final
sample size of N = 120). Study procedures for each wave of data
collection will be similar, except for Wave 2 where an fMRI scan will
occur in a second session. In addition, Wave 1 of data collection was
transitioned online due to the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Participants will therefore range in age from 6-16 years at Wave 1, 7-17
years at Wave 2, and 8-20 years at Wave 3. Participants will be
recruited through targeted mailout (birth records), online advertising
(e.g., Craigslist), school and community organization partnerships,
street-fairs and community gathering events, and flyers. After
contacting the lab to express interest in study participation, parents
of child and adolescent participants are contacted by telephone or email
to be screened for study eligibility. An experienced research associate
will conduct a scripted telephone interview to assess whether the
participant/s meet criteria for inclusion/exclusion. If participants
prefer to communicate via email, they will be sent a detailed
infographic which contains the same key information communicated in the
telephone script. In addition to this informational infographic, in the
body of the email, participants will be sent a few brief questions to
determine eligibility and basic demographics.

During this initial contact, if eligible and interested, participants
will be scheduled for their Wave 1 session and sent the consent and
assent forms. They will also be told about Wave 2-3 and that scheduling
for those visits will take place approximately 12 and 24 months after
Wave 1. Participants involved in any wave will be told that they will be
invited to participate in future waves, but are not required to do so.
When the study transitions to Wave 2, parents of children and
adolescents who participated in Wave 1 will be re-contacted and screened
for eligibility in Wave 2 using the same procedure. When the study
transitions to Wave 3, parents of children and adolescents who
participated in Wave 1 and/or Wave 2 will be re-contacted and screened
for eligibility for Wave 3.

## Measures

### Observations

#### Parent-Child Interaction

##### Description

Parents and children participated in a discussion where they were filmed
having a conversation. They were presented with a laminated sheet which
contained a list of pleasant events on one side and a list of issues on
the other side. These lists contained topics and events that children
and parents might experience (for example, pleasant events included
talking about sports, going to a concert, camping, etc., while issues
included cleaning, homework, cleanliness, etc.). Participants were
instructed to take 1-minute to choose something on the list and then
were given 5-minutes to discuss what they had chosen. They were
instructed to try to resolve the conflict and to try to plan the
pleasant event. Participants were permitted to expand beyond topics on
the list. Participants were filmed during the interaction. The conflict
interaction was completed first, and the pleasant event was discussed
second to ensure that parents were not thinking about the negative
interaction upon completing the clinical interview and questionnaires
about their child immediately after the observation. Videos were coded
using the Family Interaction Macrocoding System (FIMS)[@holmbeck_1995].

##### Coding the Interaction

-   After the observation are collected, videos will be coded by two
    observers blind to the caregiving group of the child (adversity or
    comparison).

-   Videos will be coded using the Family Interaction Macrocoding
    Schedule (FIMS)[@holmbeck_1995].

-   We ultimately decided to go with FIMS for several reasons:

    -   Expense - Approximately \$1000 USD for a 10 hour skype training
        session with one of Holmbeck's team
    -   Validation in age range - FIMS was designed for older children
        and adolescents, and Sarah Whittle has validated it in a
        community sample of 8 year olds and their mothers.
    -   FIMS is a less intensive coding schedule, producing global
        codes, rather than micro coded (i.e., minute to minute) scales -
        which makes more intuitive sense in the age range for MBB.
    -   FIMS has a peer version that we might branch out to in the
        future (but likely not needing further training)[@holbein_2014].
    -   Sarah Whittle's group looked at the component structure for the
        FIMS and found components that seemed close to what they were
        finding with the Hops LIFE system - namely: negative maternal
        affect during pleasant event, negative maternal during conflict
        discussion, and pleasant maternal affect across both tasks
        (warmth). The negative maternal during pleasant event was the
        most predictive of child behavior problems. Overall, the
        correlations they report in their paper are all very sensical
        and convinced me that we should use the FIMS [@richmond_2018]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Interviews

#### KSADS

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Physiology

##### ECG - Electrocardiogram

Child and adolescent participants will have their heart rate recorded
using a Biopac recording device. Two small stickers containing a
recording electrode are placed on the front of participant's bodies
(underneath their collarbone on the left and right side). A third
sticker, also containing a recording electrode, will be placed on
participant's left lower rib. The electrodes are attached to recording
wires, which lead to the Biopac machine, which is itself hooked up to a
computer. Participants will have their heart rate measured during all of
the computer tasks (which include playing computer games and watching
movie clips).

##### GSR - Galvanic Skin Response

Child and adolescent participants will have their GSR (sweat) response
measured while they are undergoing the computer tasks. GSR is measured
by small stickers with electrodes that are placed on the participants
hand to measure very small variations in sweating (which are a marker of
attention). Two stickers are placed on the participants non-dominant
hand, with wires leading to the Biopac machine and computer.

##### EGG - Electrogastrogram

Child and adolescent participants will have their gastric activity
monitored through an EGG. Similar to measures of heart rate, the EGG is
collected through small stickers containing recording electrodes that
are stuck on the abdomen, and are connected through recording wires to
the Biopac machine and then computer. EGG will be measured at the same
time as participants heart rate and sweat response (during the computer
tasks).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Tasks

#### Memory Intrusion

##### Description

Child and adolescent participants will listen to a list of words that
surround a theme (e.g., for the theme sleep, they might hear --
'pillow', 'bed', 'night', 'tired', 'cosy'). There will be a series of
words that are conceptually related to the theme that they do not hear
(e.g., they will not hear 'sleeping'). Then participants are asked to
recall the words they heard from the list, and the number of memory
intrusions from related but not presented words (i.e., 'sleeping') is
recorded. Participants will do two versions of this task, one preceded
by a relaxing task (neutral movie clips described above), and another
preceded by a mild stressor (sad/scary movie clips).

Note that the movie clips are age appropriate and follow film
classification guidelines for the child's/adolescent's age (i.e.,
G-rated movies for the child age group). Such movies might involve
scenes like the stampede scene from 'The Lion King'.

##### Details

Physiology Marks - We have inserted start and stop times for the
physiology for the movie component of the task, which will be used for
one of the analyses. We have also inserted physiology marks for the
start and stop times for each of the word lists, and finally for the
recall phases.

*Note: Be careful using physiology during the recall phase, as the
participant is talking during that phase.*

#### Halloween

##### Description

The Halloween task is a memory task comprised of both recognition and
associative memory components. Children are told that they are going to
play a Halloween game. In one block, they see bright and cheery indoor
and outdoor scenes, and in the next block the scenes are dark and
haunted looking. In addition to these scenes, an item (toy or candy) is
overlaid somewhere in the scene. They are told that their job is to
collect the toys and sweets and remember what house the toys/candy came
from. Each block has 20 trials (10 are the house + toy, 10 are the
house + candy). The toys/candy that are paired with the houses are not
counterbalanced, but the order of the blocks will be counterbalanced
between participants (some will have day then night, and some will have
night then day). The context is presented for 500ms before the item is
overlaid on the context image for an additional 2500ms (3000ms total).
There is a 500ms interstimulus interval between trials. There is a
self-advancing break between the blocks.

##### Background

In prior work, across typical development, the research team found that
during an associative learning task (contexts paired with objects or
faces) there were different levels of granularity in the anterior third
versus posterior third of the hippocampus - where representations were
more granular in the posterior than anterior and that this granularity
increased across age. Although brain data from previously
institutionalized youth have not yet been analyzed, we have seen
interesting behavior associations with adversity. Specifically, we see
an age by adversity interaction on memory retention, where previously
institutionalized children have better long-term memory retention, which
becomes normalized by adolescence.

To further this line of research, we will continue looking at the
association between granularity in the anterior versus posterior
hippocampus and long-term memory retention. In this task, we also
include a component looking at the role of emotion in processing. To
incorporate this, we have one block of the task being emotional or
threatening in some way -- the contexts (scenes) will be either scary or
not scary. The idea for this task comes from several papers
[@brunec_2018; @lambert_2019; @tambini_2010].

##### Details

The idea from this task comes from four papers:

1.  @tambini_2010 - enhanced brain correlations at rest are associated
    with long term memory. Based on the results of this paper,
    Callaghan, Tottenham and Davachi developed the task that Bridget
    subsequently used for the K99 grant. See details below.
2.  @brunec_2018 - Multiple scales of representation along the
    hippocampal anteroposterior axis in humans. The analysis used in
    this paper - representational granularity - we adopted for my K99
    project.
3.  Results of the K99 project - in the K99, across typical development,
    we found that during an associative learning task (contexts paired
    with objects or faces) there were different levels of granularity in
    the anterior third vs. posterior third of the hippocampus - where
    representations were more granular in the posterior than anterior
    and that this granularity increased across age. Although we have not
    yet analyzed the brain in PI youth, we have seen interesting
    behavior associations with adversity. Specifically, we see an age x
    adversity interaction on memory retention, where PI children have
    better long term memory retention, which becomes normalized by
    adolescence.
4.  @lambert_2019 - altered development of hippocampus dependent
    associative learning following early life adversity. In this paper
    they found that adversity (violence exposed youth) were impaired in
    hippocampus associative memory only when the item (faces) were
    angry. That is, when threat cues were present, they suggested that
    is hijacked encoding and made more elemental and less context
    integrated.

In the R00, I wanted to continue looking at the association between
granularity in the anterior vs. posterior hippocampus and long term
memory retention. However, rather than do the exact same task as the in
the K99, I wanted to include a component that looked at the role of
emotion in processing. One way to do this is doing the same item +
context task as I did during the K99, but having one of the runs of the
task being emotional or threatening in some way.

Idea for the halloween game:

Items will be toys and sweets, and the contexts will either be scary or
not scary. This is different than the Lambert study in that her contexts
were neutral and the items (i.e., faces) were angry or not. So therefore
the scary item prevented the processing of the context. In this version,
the context will be scary and the item will be neutral - so will the
context hijack the processing and make the scary run harder for
adversity exposed kids to learn the association? Or will it be the
opposite, heightening attention and improving learning?

Structure of the game: Children will be told that they are going to play
a halloween game. In one run, they will see bright and cheery indoor and
outdoor scenes, and in the next run the scenes will be dark and haunted
looking. They will be told that their job is to collect the toys and
sweets and remember what house the toys/sweets came from.

![<!--- halloween --->](images/information/measures/tasks/halloween/1.png)

This is the basic structure of each block. First there is a fixation
cross for 1 second, then a house will appear on the screen for 500ms,
then the house+toy/sweets will appear on the screen for an addition 2.5
seconds (total of 3 seconds for the house and the house+toy/sweet, then
there will be a baseline period that is jittered in length. The baseline
is jittered in the MRI but it will be a fixed length of 1 seconds in the
lab-based version of the task. In the MRI the active baseline will
involve pressing buttons to indicate the direction of arrows on the
screen, in the lab-based version of the task, it involves simply looking
at a fixation dot.

There will be two blocks (day, and night). The day block is the
emotionally neutral block, whereas the night block is the scary block.
Each block has 20 trials (10 are the house + toy, 10 are the house +
sweets). The toys/sweets that are paired with the houses are not
counterbalanced, but the order of the blocks will be counterbalanced
between participants (some will have day then night, and the rest will
have night then day).

As an added layer to this task, we will not only pair an item with a
house, but we will place it on top of the house in one quadrant. To
encode a detailed associative memory, the individual will need to
remember what item was paired with the house and then what quadrant it
was in. For this test, a picture of a house will be shown along with 3
choices for which item matches with the house, one being correct and 2
serving as filler "foils." The two "foil" options are items from other
houses, so the child will have seen them before. Each item will both be
a correct answer for the house it was initially paired with and a foil
answer for two other houses throughout the trial. Additionally, the
child will have to recall which quadrant the selected item was in on the
house. The quadrants appear

For the recognition test there should be an equal number of foils as
target items.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Characters (monsters/aliens)

##### Description

Participants are instructed that their job in this game is to learn
which "character" is right and which is wrong through trial-and-error.
Participants are presented two stimuli side-by-side for 3500
milliseconds and indicate which character they choose by using the left
and right arrow keys on the keyboard. Stimuli are presented in pairs AB,
CD, EF (and their counterbalanced version BA, DC, FE). Stimuli A is
correct in the AB/BA trials 80% of the time. Stimuli C is correct in the
CD/DC trials 70% of the time. Stimuli E is correct in the EF/FE trials
60% of the time. Stimuli are randomly shuffled and assigned a letter at
the beginning of the task. For Mind, Brain, Body, the stimuli consisted
of colorful monsters/aliens.

If participants choose "correctly" they will see a green check mark and
hear "ding" sound. If they choose "incorrectly" they will see a red x
mark and hear a "horn" sound. If they take longer than 3500 milliseconds
to respond, they are shown a screen that says "Too Slow". All feedback
is presented for 2000 milliseconds before moving on to the next trial.
Stimuli pairs are presented 10 times each in random order in each block
(total of 60 trials). PsychoPy tallies the correct and incorrect
responses on a block-by-block basis. Participants move onto the test
phase once they have reached a performance criterion (65% accuracy for
AB/BA trials, 60% accuracy for CD/DC trials, 50% accuracy for EF/FE
trials). If participants do not reach criterion, they are automatically
directed to the test after reaching a certain number of blocks (3 for
children, 5 for adolescents).

During the test, participants are presented with all training pairs
(AB/BA, CD/DC, EF/FE), and novel pairs including A and B (AC/CA, AD/DA,
AE/EA, AF/FA, BC/CB, BD/DB, BE/EB, BF/FB). Test pairs are each presented
6 times. This section is untimed, and no feedback is provided.

##### Background

The characters task assesses learning. It is a cognitive reinforcement
learning task in which participants must learn to choose one stimulus
over another through reinforcement. Participants can employ two
strategies to learn the correct response---either they can learn to
choose stimulus 'A' or to avoid stimulus 'B'. At test, these stimuli are
paired with novel stimuli. If participants choose stimulus 'A' over the
novel stimulus, that is evidence of positive feedback learning. If
participants choose the novel stimulus over stimulus 'B', that is
evidence of negative feedback learning. As a result, this task allows
for direct comparison of sensitivity to these two types of learning
[@frank_2004].

##### Details

PsychoPy parameters should be set to:

-   10 trial_loop nreps
-   3 test_loop nreps
-   Maximum 5 block_loops nreps (advances after criterion is met)

Physiology markers are set to:

-   Channel 1 (28) - Train stimulus onset
-   Channel 2 (29) - Check
-   Channel 3 (30) - X
-   Channel 4 (31) - Miss
-   Channel 5 (32) - Test stimulus onset

Task based on original task by @frank_2004, re-programmed and adapted by
Emily Towner and Ryan Burnell.

#### Discrimination / Conditioning / Extinction

##### Description

Children and adolescent participants will take part in a visual
perceptual threshold task. Participants will be shown visual stimuli
(e.g., two black stripes at different orientations, or two Gabors with
different levels of contrast) and asked to discriminate between them:
"which stripe is rotated more clockwise 1 or 2?" for the stripes, or
"which picture is darker/clearer 1 or 2?" for the Gabors. The magnitude
of the difference between the two choices will be decreased after two
correct choices, and increased after one correct choice, and will be
continued until 6 wrong choices are made. The smallest magnitude where
participants were able to correctly identify the stripe or Gabor in
question is their Just Noticeable Difference (JND) threshold. The JND
will be calculated before and after the threat learning task, and after
the extinction task.

##### Details

This task has two purposes.

1.  The first is to simply look at threat learning and extinction in
    children and adolescents across typical development and after
    adversity exposure. This has been done many times before, but we
    will also have children attached to an electrogastrogram (EGG -
    which is completely novel), GSR (sweat - which is the common
    measure), and heart rate (which is somewhat common but less so in
    the conditioning literature) while they and learning and
    extinguishing.
2.  The second purpose of the task is to look at how conditioning and
    extinction affect perceptual thresholds. This is built from a large
    literature in adults showing that threat learning can lead to a
    broadening or narrowing of tuning curves following threat
    conditioning, depending on the specific parameters in place (more
    narrowing - i.e., better, occurs when a discriminatory conditioning
    procedure is employed and where the CS- and the CS+ and really
    different; more broadening occurs when the CS- and the CS+ are
    similar and when there is not explicit discriminative conditioning.
    We are going to employ a form of conditioning that has been shown to
    lead to perceptual broadening in adults.

Past literature: This paper by @shalev_2018 demonstrates the effect we
are trying to test in children/adolescents. They use an across sensory
modality procedure (CSs = auditory, USs = visual) and between subjects
design (control group = CS+ are positive/neutral, and experiments group
where CS+ are negative) with pre/post perceptual tuning curves to
determine the effect of threat learning on sensory discrimination.

The basic task structure:

![<!--- disc/cond/ext --->](images/information/measures/tasks/disc_cond_ext/1.png)

The task and results:

They find that when the CS+ is paired with the aversive picture, people
show a deterioration in their ability to discriminate the CS+ from tones
that are similar to it, whereas they show very little change in their
ability to discriminate the CS- from tones that are similar to it. They
saw the same thing with gabors that differed in contrast (right) and
lines that differed in orientation (left).

![](images/information/measures/tasks/disc_cond_ext/3.png)
![](images/information/measures/tasks/disc_cond_ext/4.png)

Current Task Structure:

We will use an approach where we pair aversive/pleasant noises (USs)
with lines at different orientations (CSs). In the control group the
noise will be pleasant or neutral. In the experimental group the noise
will be aversive.

![<!--- disc/cond/ext --->](images/information/measures/tasks/disc_cond_ext/5.png)

The timeline of the task will be as follows:

![<!--- disc/cond/ext --->](images/information/measures/tasks/disc_cond_ext/6.png)

-   Number of trials was based on review of five papers [@norrholm_2011
    (56 trials); @norrholm_2006 (72 trials); @schiller_2013 (32 trials);
    @phelps_2004 (34 trials); @jovanovic_2014].

The experimental protocol consisted of two phases: fear acquisition and
extinction. The sessions were separated by 10 minutes. The acquisition
phase consisted of 3 blocks, each with 3 CS+ trials, 3 CS− trials, and 3
noise alone (NA, no CS presented during startle probe) trials, for a
total of 27 startle trials. Both CSs were colored shapes presented on a
computer monitor for 6000 ms prior to the delivery of the startle probe,
and co-terminated with the US 500 ms after the presentation of the
startle stimulus. The CS+ was reinforced with the airblast 100% of the
time. The extinction phase consisted of 4 blocks with 3 trials of each
type. The CSs were same as above, except that the CS+ was no longer
paired with the airblast. In all phases of the experiment, inter-trial
intervals will be randomized between 9 and 22 seconds.

#### Memory Generalization

### Tests

#### WASI

#### WIAT

Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT) -- 4-85 years.
Child/adolescent self-report. Domain assessed cognitive function. The
WIAT is a comprehensive yet flexible measurement tool useful for
achievement skills assessment, learning disability diagnosis, special
education placement, and clinical appraisal for preschool children
through adults. Norms allow for assessment of those from ages 4 to 85.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Measurements

#### Height & Weight

Tri-ponderal mass (TPM) and body mass index (BMI) will be calculated
using height and weight measurements. TPM/BMI has been related to the
microbiome in past studies and is important to consider as a confounding
variable in those analyses, as well as an outcome variable related to
early adversity.

#### Waist Circumference

Waist circumference will be taken using measuring tape around the child
and adolescent participant's waist. This will be an outcome measure
related to effects of early adversity exposure on physical development.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Biological Samples

#### Hair sample

Child and adolescent participants will donate a head hair sample for the
purpose of measuring average cortisol levels during the past month. To
collect the sample, a few strands of hair behind the crown of the head
will be cut close to the root. This method of collecting hair is not
invasive and has been performed in babies [32 weeks of age;
@staufenbiel_2013]. Hair samples will never be used for genetic
analysis.

#### Saliva sample

Saliva samples will be collected from child and adolescent participants
in the lab using omnigene oral tubes (dnagenotek). Participants spit
into a tube using a saliva collection kit. If participants are unable to
spit, they will place small sterilized sponges in their mouths to
collect the saliva. The sponges are then placed into the tube. After the
cap of the tube is closed, it will break open a seal inside that
releases a stabilizing solution into the tube which stabilizes the
saliva. The saliva will be used to analyze bacteria in the oral cavity.
The stabilization technique we use allows the saliva samples to remain
at ambient temperature for several months. In batches, the saliva will
sent to the processing facility. The samples will be labelled with
participant ID codes only -- no personally identifying information. Only
microbial DNA, not human DNA, is analyzed in these samples.

Hair samples were processed and analyzed according to the methods
described in Meyer et al. (2014) with minor modifications. Briefly, each
sample was weighed, washed twice with isopropanol to remove external
contaminants, and then air-dried. Washed samples were ground to a fine
powder using a bead mill, extracted overnight into methanol, and
centrifuged to spin down the beads and the powdered hair. An aliquot of
the methanol extract was transferred to a clean tube, dried using a
vacuum evaporator, and then reconstituted in assay buffer. Reconstituted
extracts were spin-filtered to remove any residual particulate material,
then assayed in duplicate along with standards and quality controls
using the Arbor Assays DetectX Cortisol ELISA kit. Intra- and
inter-assay coefficients of variation for this assay are both \<10%

#### Blood sample

Dried Blood Spot Collection (in-person): Participants can opt into or
out of participating in the dried blood spot collection (identified
during the consent process). Those who opt into the blood spot
collection will have one finger on their non¬dominant hand pricked in
order to provide approximately ten drops of blood that will be placed on
special filter paper cards and examined for circulating and molecular
markers of inflammation. We will not collect blood from participants who
are feeling ill or participants who take anticoagulants or blood
thinners (e.g. Heparin, Warfarin -- verified through medication
checklist). Participants will be offered a Virtual Reality (VR)
immersive headset to watch a video during the blood spot procedure.
Previous studies have empirically demonstrated that VR can significantly
reduce child/adolescent anxiety about blood spot/draw procedures. The
trained researcher will massage the finger to be pricked to draw the
blood circulation to that area, and will use BD Microtainer
contact-activated lancets to make one prick the middle or ring finger on
the non-dominant hand, disposing of the lancet in a bio¬hazard sharps
container immediately. This procedure is similar to what
children/adolescent may experience at a pediatrician visit. Five drops
of blood are placed onto each of two Whatman 903 Proteinsaver cards (GE
Healthcare Bio¬Sciences). After collection, the finger will be cleaned
(with an alcohol swab), dried with gauze, and bandaged. Blood spot
samples will be dried overnight, then closed, labeled with ID number and
date, and stored in a small plastic bag with a desiccant pack. Bags are
stored in -¬80 Celsius freezer until shipped for further processing.
When shipped for further processing, the bags are placed in an insulated
box with dry ice before being transported for analysis. Blood test
results are not diagnostic and will not be shared with study
participants. Risks of the procedure include temporary soreness at the
site of the finger prick, or in very rare circumstances, infection. To
minimize the risk of infection, we will follow sterile procedures,
including the use of sterile, one-time-use lancets, sterile
gauze/bandage, and alcohol wipes of the site. Blood will be collected in
the Health Psychology Lab in Franz or in the SAND lab in Franz, which
has a drape to maintain cleanliness of the collection area, a sharps
container, as well as antibacterial cleaning materials to maintain
cleanliness of the collection room. Experimenters performing the needle
prick will wear gloves throughout the procedure and wear covered
clothing as a safety precaution. The non¬dominant hand will be used and
bandaged to avoid soreness from overuse at the site of the finger prick.
If there is no blood, or not sufficient blood on the first finger prick,
a second prick will be attempted on a different finger to avoid
unnecessary discomfort. Experimenters performing the finger prick will
be trained and certified in dried blood spot collection.

Tasso DBS collection (over zoom): Tasso-M20 kits were used during Wave 2
to collect dried blood spots from consenting children remotely over
Zoom. Kits are shipped to participants with their magic box, families
are instructed on how to use them to collect DBS during session 2, and
then the samples are shipped back to our lab within 24 hours of
collection (see Wave 2 protcol for more information on participant
collection). Drying the blood spots promptly and fully is important for
maintaining integrity of the RNA and cytokines contained within it. The
Tasso kits contain several features that facilitate quick drying of the
blood spots, including a tab the participant pulls to release a drying
accelerant, and a dessicant pack inside the bag the participant sends
the sample back in that dries out the air inside; thus, leaving the
sample out to dry is not needed. In terms of measures of circulating
cytokines from the DBS, Tasso said that how long we could store the
samples at room temperature depends on the analyte. Not much has been
published on the stability of inflammatory cytokines in DBS at room
temperature; most studies have been with serum blood collected by
venipuncture. Some cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha) are unstable in serum
stored at room temperature, but all are stable in serum stored in a
refrigerator. The single study that investigated stability of DBS CRP
found it to be stable at ambient temperature (21 degrees C) for up to 1
week ([Brindle et al.,
2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.795580/full#B29)).
However, research does show that refrigerating or freezing samples
promptly after drying is always advisable to minimize the chances of
degradation, even though the stability of most analytes in DBS provides
flexibility in the collection of samples in field settings ([McDade et
al., 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18232218/)). That is why our
protocol instructs participants to send back the Tasso kits within 24
hours of sample collection.

#### Stool sample

A stool sample will be collected from the child and adolescent
participants in their home with the assistance of their parent using
omnigene gut tubes (dnagenotek). Using a regular toilet, participants
use the paper toilet hat to catch the stool. Participants will use a
small sterile spatula to collect a pea sized amount of stool from the
toilet hat and place it in the tube. After the lid is sealed, with the
sample inside, the participant will shake the tube. A homogenization
bead inside will break up the sample and cover all of the sample with a
stabilizing liquid. The participant will place the stool sample into a
biohazard bag, into a padded mailer, which will be returned to the lab
through the registered post. The stabilization technique we use allows
the stool samples to remain at ambient temperature for several weeks.
Once the sample arrives at the lab, it will be placed into the locked
-80 Celcius freezer until processing. Once all samples are collected we
will pack the samples in dry ice and send to the processing facility.
The samples will be labelled with participant ID codes only -- no
personally identifying information. Only microbial DNA, not human DNA,
is analyzed in these samples.

Note: On Nov 16, 2020 there was a product change notification sent by
DNA Genotek regarding the OMNIgene•GUT (OM/R-200, OM/R-200.100) and
PERFORMAbiome•GUT (PB-200) devices. In brief, DNA Genotek removed "Made
in Canada" from their packaging and updated the lot information
(reflected in the barcode), to allow for an increase in manufacturing
sites sand production lots sizes. This is to note that different sites
may have made the omnigene packages we use in different study waves.

#### Microbiome Sequencing

Work was performed at the OKED Genomics Core at Arizona State University.

•	Caporaso, J. G., Lauber, C. L., Walters, W. A., Berg-Lyons, D., Lozupone, C. A., Turnbaugh, P. J., Noah Fierer, N., & Knight, R. (2011). Global patterns of 16S rRNA diversity at a depth of millions of sequences per sample. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 108, 4516–4522. http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1000080107

**DNA extraction:** Microbial DNA extraction was extracted from samples
by using DNeasy PowerSoil Kit -- (QIAGEN) following directions of the
manufacturer.

**Microbiome library preparation methodology:** Bacterial community
analysis is performed via next generation sequencing in MiSeq Illumina
platform. Amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene is
performed with the barcoded primer set 515f/806r designed by Caporaso et
al. 2011 and following the protocol by the Earth Microbiome Project
(EMP) (<http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocols/>) for the
library preparation. PCR amplifications for each sample are done in
duplicate, then pooled and quantified using an accublue kit. A no
template control sample is included during the library preparation as a
control for extraneous nucleic acid contamination. 240 ng of DNA per
sample are pooled and then cleaned using QIA quick PCR purification kit
(QIAGEN). The pool is quantified by using the qubit. Then, the DNA pool
is diluted to a final concentration of 4 nM then denatured and diluted
to a final concentration of 4 pM with a 25% of PhiX. Finally, the DNA
library is loaded in the MiSeq Illumina and run using the version 2
module, 2x250 paired-end, following the directions of the manufacturer.

**Metagenomics Library Preparation methodology:** Illumina compatible
Genomic DNA libraries were generated on an Eppendorf epMotion 5075
liquid handler using Kapa Biosystem's Hyper plus library preparation kit
(KK8514). DNA was enzymatically sheared to approximately 300bp
fragments, end repaired and A-tailed as described in the Kapa protocol.
Illumina-compatible adapters with unique indexes (IDT #00989130v2) were
ligated on each sample individually. The adapter ligated molecules were
cleaned using Kapa pure beads (Kapa Biosciences, KK8002), and amplified
with Kapa's HIFI enzyme (KK2502). Each library was then analyzed for
fragment size on an Agilent's Tapestation, and quantified by qPCR (KAPA
Library Quantification Kit, KK4835) on Thermo Fisher Scientific's
Quantstudio 5 before multiplex pooling and sequencing using 2 lanes of
an S4 300 flow cell on the NovaSeq platform (Illumina) at the
Collaborative Sequencing Center (TGen).

##### FCI and IAI Data Consolidation  

The Foster Care Inventory (FCI) and International Adoption Inventory (IAI) were collected from caregivers at Wave 1, and recollected at Wave 2 for those who didn't complete them during W1. Additionally, a shorter version of the FCI/IAI with additional explanations and visual examples (called "fci_3questions") was administered at Wave 3, due to concerns that caregivers weren't understanding the questions on the FCI/IAI. After W3 data collection was complete, Fran consolidated the FCI/IAI data for each participant across the study: for those who provided the data at multiple waves, if there was a discrepancy in age left bio family, age entered stable care, or number of transitions, Fran used the number of transitions datapoints from the fci_3questions at W3 and picked one of the data points for age left bio care and age entered stable care based on which one made the most sense (e.g., if the caregiver said the child was 3.5 years old when they left bio care and 3.5 years old when they entered stable care at W1, but reported 5 caregiving transitions at W3, then I took the W3 datapoints for age left bio care and age entered stable care). Note: Fran's impression when consolidating the data is that there is less uncertainty within the final number of transitions variable compared to the age left bio care and age entered stable care, so Fran recommends using the number of tranisitions viariable. The final consolidated data (fci_consolidated_final.csv) can be found in the Scripts folder in subfolder: "FCI_W1_W3_Consolidation".

Domain assessed: Emotional impacts of COVID-19. This self-report measure
consists of one long-form qualitative response, prompting a parent to
write continuously for five minutes about the impacts of COVID-19 on
their life and family. This qualitative response was adapted from
previous prompts in writing about emotional experiences, and seeks to
assess the emotional and behavioral impacts of the Pandemic on children
and families.

comfortable writing, children can dictate and parent can write). This
qualitative response was adapted from previous prompts in writing about
emotional experiences, and seeks to assess the emotional and behavioral
impacts of the Pandemic on children and families.
