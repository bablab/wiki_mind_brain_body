## Child/Teen & Parent General Protocols

### consent

Once the parent and child/teen come into the lab, seat them in the Rainbow Room on the couch for consenting (parent) and assenting (child aged 7+ or teen). 

Make some small talk - Ask the participant how they got here. If they have participated before in research. Offer them a bottle of water. Thank them for coming and for giving up their weekend to help science.

Tell the parent and child that the first thing you are going to do is go over all of the things they will do today, and have them sign the consent and assent forms. 

Speak to them and direct them through the whole process. 

#### Things you will do in the lab

- Stick stickers on you to measure heart rate, sweat, stomach muscles.
- Sit with parent and talk about fun things and hard things (filming).
- Parent stays in room and answers more questions. 
- Child goes next door to play computer games (look at pictures, watch movies). Some of the movies and pictures will be a little bit scary, others sad, others boring. 
- One of the games involves a loud annoying noise, we will adjust it for you. 
- You will also do some other games on paper and pencil - like puzzle and word games
- You will answer some questionnaires
- We will also measure your height, weight, and waist circumference. 
- We will take three biological samples: 
    - Hair - stress hormones
    - Saliva - microbiome 
    - Blood - immune - wear goggles
- Do you get sick or dizzy when you see blood or hurt yourself? 
- If we need to, can we prick two fingers?
- When you are done with all of that, you will get a big prize, then we will pay you and you will go home. 
- You will get $45 for the work you put in today.

#### Things you will do at home

<h4>Child</h4>

- Poop sample - [microbiome](#consent)
- Stool scale
- Memory game - to see what you remember from lab.

<h4>Parent</h4>

- 24 hour food recall

When you complete the poop sample and the games at home, we will pay you another $20 in the form of a giftcard. 

#### Things to know

You are a volunteer, which means that you do not have to do anything, or say anything that makes you uncomfortable. We would like you to try everything you can, and to do your best, but if there are things you absolutely do not want to do, just tell us, that is o.k.

We keep your participation confidential - ID number. 

We want you to come in again in the future, so we will ask for some information so we can contact you in the future. 

*Sign consent/assent forms including DBS form and Contact Sheet*

### Recruitment

#### Pre-Screening

 1. Check if participant is in Recruitment Database
     - If not, add them to the Recruitment Database
 3. Check if participant is in ID Drive
    - If yes, check if they have a Screener ID
    - If not, assign them a Screener ID once contact has been established based on the next available Screener ID # in REDCap and proceed with screening
    - If yes, proceed with screening under existing Screener ID in REDCap

#### Screening

1. To screen a new participant click “Add / Edit Records”
![<!--- recap_screening --->](images/redcap_screening/1.png)
2.  Click to enter a new Subject ID
    - Make sure Arm 1: Recruitment is selected
3. Type “SMBB#” (Screener ID) to create a record and hit “Enter”
    - Make sure to link the participants Screener ID and their name on the **ID Drive ONLY**
    - Before creating a new record, be sure to check the ID Drive to see if the participant already has an existing Screener ID
    - If a record exists, add a new instance of the screen instead of creating a new record
![<!--- recap_screening --->](images/redcap_screening/2.png)
4. The screening arm contains two parts
    - The screen
    - The wave1_status
        - The wave1_status is to be updated after the first and each subsequent contact
![<!--- recap_screening --->](images/redcap_screening/3.png)
5. Click on the radio button in the “screen” row to screen the participant
![<!--- recap_screening --->](images/redcap_screening/4.png)
6. Click “Now” to enter today’s date and time
7. Select the appropriate choice to start the phone call and follow the skip logic
8. Follow the skip logic to the end
    - For items without a text field, write the information down in the Recruitment database (This identifying information cannot be on REDCap)
9. Once done, select “Complete” and “Save & Exit Form”
    - The screen can be entered multiple times - for instance if there are multiple phone calls or contacts
    - It is important to keep a record of all instances of contact
![<!--- recap_screening --->](images/redcap_screening/5.png)
10. Click the screen_status radio button
![<!--- recap_screening --->](images/redcap_screening/6.png)
11. Select the appropriate option
     - Contact - Participant needs to be re-contacted (add Recruitment Database & ID Drive)
     - Ineligible - Participant not eligible for study
     - To Enroll - Participant to enroll (need to create subject ID, enter subject info, schedule participant, add to Recruitment Database, add to ID Drive)
     - Enrolled - Participant has been enrolled (all above have been completed)
     - To Remove - Participant wants to be removed
12. Be sure to update the screen status after each contact
     - After 3 contacts (with no response) - review (time of day, contact method, etc.)
13. If enrolled, proceed to pre-session checklist in the participant log


#### Other Screening Information

<h4>Accessing Lists</h4>

To find out where participants are in the recruitment process, there are several lists. 
![<!--- recap_screening --->](images/redcap_screening/7.png)
1. Click on “Record Status Dashboard”
![<!--- recap_screening --->](images/redcap_screening/8.png)
2. Participants who have been enrolled will be listed in the Enrollment - Wave 1 list
3. Participants in the process of recruitment will be listed in one of the 4 Recruitment lists
    - *These lists are populated based on the individuals “Screen Status” so be sure to update after each contact!

<h4>List Types</h4>

- Contact - List of individuals who need to be contacted or re-contacted (also includes waitlist)
- Ineligible - Participants are ineligible but interested
- To Enroll - Participants who have been screened and are eligible to enroll
- To Remove - Participants who were not interested in being contacted for this or future research

### Addressing Concerns

If a parent has a concern about the study before the session, send the email template: 

- [MBB - CONCERNS]

### Parent/Child Observation

The parent and child will be in the Rainbow Room for 15 minutes. During that time they will be filmed while planning a conflict event, and then again while discussing a pleasant event. The conflict event will always go first, followed by the pleasant event. We did this to ensure that the parents were not thinking of the negative interaction upon answering the questionnaires about their child, which they did immediately after the observation interaction. If participants indicate that they prefer to speak in a language other than English, they may do so.

**Step 1**: 

Parent and child will be situated on the grey couch in the Rainbow Room. The iPad video camera will be placed about 4 feet away from the dyad, on a tripod stand. The screen of the iPad will be facing away from the parent and child.

![<!--- parent:child_obser --->](images/parent:child_obser/2.png)


**Step 2**:

The researcher will give the parent and child the Pleasant Events Checklist (PEC) on a piece of paper. 

*Researcher: Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss a source of conflict (or something you disagree on). On this piece of paper is a list of things that parents and children sometimes have disagreements about. Please take a moment to read the list and think about some that you would like to discuss together. When I knock on the door, please start discussing the things you have selected from the list. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from the list, or decide to choose something else not included on the list.I will give you five minutes to discuss the event, then I will come back and give you further instructions.*

**Step 3**: 

Researcher press record on the iPad and leave the room. Start timer for 1 minute, then knock on the door and ask the dyad to begin discussing their event. Start timer for 5 minutes. At the end of 5 minutes, again knock on the door and enter the Rainbow Room. 

*Researcher: Thank you for taking the time to discuss the source of conflict. Next we are going to take some film of you while you discuss a pleasant event you could do together. On this piece of paper is a list of events that parents and children sometimes find pleasant to do together. Please take a moment to read the list of events and think about what you would like to plan to do together. When I knock on the door, please start discussing the event you would like to do together and make a plan for how you could do it. You do not need to tell us what you chose to discuss, and it does not matter if you chose something from the list, or decide to choose something else not included on the list. I will give you five minutes to discuss the event, then I will come back and give you further instructions.*

**Step 4**: 

Researcher press record on the iPad and leave the room. Start timer for 1 minute, then knock on the door and ask the dyad to begin discussing their event. Start timer for 5 minutes. At the end of 5 minutes, again knock on the door and enter the Rainbow Room. 

**Step 5**: 

Researcher reenter the room, switch the iPad off and move the child/adolescent to their next session.

#### Coding the Interview

- After the interviews are collected, videos will be coded by two observers blind to the caregiving group of the child (adversity or comparison). 

- Our original plan was to follow the LIFE coding system developed by Hops:
   - Hops H, Davis B, Longoria N. Methodological issues in direct observation – Illustrations with the Living in Familial Environments (LIFE) coding system. Journal of Clinical Child Psychology. 1995;24:193–203. [Google Scholar](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15374424jccp2402_7?journalCode=hcap19)

- However, this system is prohibitively expensive and very training intensive. Instead we decided to go with either of the following two coding schedules: 
   - 1. Family Interaction Macrocoding Schedule (FIMS) Holmbeck, Zebracki, Johnson, Belvedere, & Hommeyer, 2007.
   - 2. CIB Training with Ruth Feldman.
   
- We ultimately decided to go with FIMS for several reasons: 
    - Expense - Sarah Whittle paid approximately $ 1000USD for a 10 hour skype training session with one of Holmbeck’s team), whereas CIB training is /$2500 and also involves flights and accommodation at Yale. 
    - Validation in age range - I like CIB for younger children, but FIMS was designed for older children and adolescents, and Sarah Whittle has validated it in a community sample of 8 year olds and their mothers. 
    - FIMS is a less intensive coding schedule, producing global codes, rather than micro coded (i.e., minute to minute) scales - which makes more intuitive sense in the age range for MBB. 
    - FIMS has a peer version that we might brach out to in the future (but likely not needing further training): https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-24011-001
    - Sarah Whittle’s group looked at the component structure for the FIMS and found components that seemed close to what they were finding with the Hops LIFE system - namely: negative maternal affect during pleasant event, negative maternal during conflict discussion, and pleasant maternal affect across both tasks (warmth). The negative maternal during pleasant event was the most predictive of child behavior problems. Overall, the correlations they report in their paper are all very sensical and convinced me that we should use the FIMS. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1073191118796557
