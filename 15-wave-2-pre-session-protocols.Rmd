## W2 Protocols - Pre-session 1 


### W2 Protocol - Scheduling 


#### Important Notes 


- Participant retention is super important for wave 2.
- There will be a script on REDCap for making calls, just follow the script.
- We are not rescreening them, the call will be just for letting them know we're now in wave 2 and scheduling their session
- All attempts at contacting participant including reaching out to the individuals on their contact lists should be documented as a screening on REDCap. Make sure to always make a note of voicemail left, email sent etc.
- Remember to change the recontect date after each contact attempt and to lock each screening so there is unaltered record of who reached out and when.
- **Parents will verbally opt in to text reminders at the time of screen call which will be their “consent” to be texted.**
- **Age in the "Participant" part of REDCap should be the age of participant at the time of *Session 1* **


#### Contacting participants 


*Before contacting participant check their Wave 1 session notes ( session checklists from REDCap) to see if there is any relevant / important information you should know before reaching out. Also take a look at email correspondence with them to make sure did not miss anything important.*
  - Know the month they participated in Wave 1 so you can reference that in the call. ( Ex. you participated in wave 1 of our study back in January 2020) 


1) 1st attempt – call #1 and if no answer leave a voicemail ( script on REDCap) and send template email #1
2) 2nd attempt ( 4 days later ) – call #2 and if no answer leave a voicemail ( script on REDCap) & also send a text message ( *Hi, this is the Brain and Body lab at UCLA. We wanted to get in touch with you about the second wave of our Mind, Brain, Body study. Please call us at 310-909-7083* )
3) 3rd attempt ( 4 days later ) - call #3 and if no answer leave a voicemail ( script on REDCap) and send template email #2
4) 4th attempt ( 4 days later ) – call #4 and if no answer leave a voicemail ( script on REDCap), send template email #3 and send a text message *( Hi, this is the Brain and Body lab at UCLA. We wanted to get in touch with you about the second wave of our Mind, Brain, Body study. Please call us at 310-909-7083. **If we do not hear from you we will be contacting the individuals you listed as contacts during wave 1 of the study**)*


**Important: We will be contacting participants ( calls, texts, and emails) for two weeks and if no response then reach out to participant's contacts listed on contact list before giving a month break**

After two week of no response to calls, emails and texts:

- At this point we will be in contact with the people they listed on contact list ( I.e. relative or otherwise)

- There will be a separate script for calling the contact of participant

- **Super important to note that we *cannot* say we are calling because [ participant name] participated in our study.**

- We can only say we are from Brain and Body lab and were hoping to get in contact with [participant name]. Could they please give us their contact info or have them reach out to us.

  - *Hi, this [ researcher name] from the Brain and Body lab. [Participant name] gave us your contact information in case we couldn’t find them do you know if they changed their number?*


1) 1st attempt - call first person on contact list and leave a voicemail if no answer
2) 2nd attempt ( 4 days later ) - call that person again and leave a voicemail if no answer. If email is provided, send email requesting they have participant reach out to us
3) Repeat steps 1 & 2 for the second person on the contact list
4) Repeat steps 1 & 2 for the third person on the contact list
5) If still have not gotten in contact with participant then at this stage set recontact date to one month later


#### Scheduling Participant


If participant says “No” to participating:

- *You are not obligated to participate in the research, we are very motivated to have you back. Is there anything we can do to have you return for wave 2? * Get a feel of where they stand on participating in wave 2 / there's reasoning for not wanting to participate. Use your judgement on which of options below would apply

  - It is a timing issue - Should we call you back in a couple months?

  - Or if there's any components you found boring, we can cut those out. we can work with you to keep you in the study as much as we possibly can

  - Would you be willing to JUST do XYZ (e.g. bio samples, behavioral, questionnaires), session delay is fine too, (any data we can get from them is helpful)

  - This longitudinal study is really important for us, your participation matters to us. It is ok if you don't want to participate but we want to do everything we can to accommodate if possible.


#### Scheduling Session


1. Open Bab Lab google calendar and note availability for designated data collection research team.
2. Check the calendar to see what the designated "package mailing day" of the week is.
    - Participants must be scheduled 2 weeks or more in advance from the "package mailing day", to ensure appropriate time for the package to be received by the participant.
3. Create event on google calendar for 2 hours. Notify the participant that sessions may not last the full indicated time, however, we like to designate additional time just in case.
4. As soon as the participant has been scheduled, create/add to a google calendar event for the designated "package mailing day" of the week the participant ID (MBB number).
5. This will notify the Lab Manager to create a package for this participant with session and post-session materials when they go into the lab for "package mailing day."
6. Go to [MBB_W2_recollected_surveys](https://app.box.com/file/788366897927) and check if they were missing surveys from wave 1 and if any of their missing surveys are Recollected Surveys for wave 2.
    - if they should be given a recollected survey make a note of it on participant tab of REDCap in notes section and send a slack message to lab manager with the recollected surveys participant should receive (parent surveys that will need to be printed or child surveys we will administer during session 
7. Complete all scheduling steps according to participant log ( making reminder calendar events, updating logs, etc)
8. Fill in the ASA cover sheet with their ASA ID and password ( found in ID drive folder of MBB). The template is in the info folder for each participant on Box

### W2 Protocol - Session Preparation  


#### Package creation 

- There will be a designated "package mailing day" one day a week in which the Lab Manager will go into the lab to prepare necessary materials and send out packages from scheduled participants in the last week, on the same package mailing day. 
- Once the package materials have been put together, it is time to bring the package down to the mailroom in the Psychology building, Tyler's Office 
    - If you go to the mailroom or to Tyler's Office, you need to have your own box. Tyler can tape up the box for you if needed. 
- To mail the package to the participant, you will need the following information: 
    - Recharge ID 
    - Participant name 
    - Participant mailing address 
    - Lab mailing address 
- From the mailroom: you can write the addresses directly on the box, and circle the recharge ID. Leave the box on the table above the "outgoing mail" sign.  
- From Tyler's office: you will receive a FedEx label in which you can write this information. Take a picture of the tracking number and save OFFLINE. Leave the box in Tyler's office for FedEx to pick up.  


#### Activating participant on Gorilla 

1. Log in to Gorilla 
2. Navigate to Projects/MBB/MBB_wave_2_online 
3. Navigate to the participants tab 
4. Click "Activate" for the designated participant 

*see pre-session 1 Wave 1 for further details  


#### Obtaining ASA codes

1. Navigate to Box (BABLAB>Studies>Mind_Brain_Body>ID_drive>MBB_asa_usernames_passwords)
2. **Remember: you CANNOT copy the username into the confirmation email, due to its identifying nature**
3. Participants should have this information on an "ASA Cover sheet" in their paper parentproxy packets
  - Another place to check their ASA codes is their ASA Cover sheet which is located in their MBB Wave 2 data folders in Info>asa_cover_sheet
